At present, treatments are symptomatic but disease-modifying therapies are under evaluation. Given the small effect size of clinical scales in AMN, biomarkers with higher effect size are needed. Here we used high-resolution magnetic resonance techniques to identify non-invasive in vivo biomarkers of the brain and spine with high effect sizes. METHODS: We performed a multiparametric imaging and spectroscopy study in 23 male patients with AMN (age: 44 +/- 11) and 23 male controls (age: 43 +/- 11) of similar age and body-mass index. We combined (i) macrostructural analyses of the spine, using cross-sectional area (CSA) and magnetization transfer ratio (MTR), (ii) microstructural analyses of the spine and the brain, using diffusion tensor and the newly developed fixel-based analysis, and (iii) advanced metabolic analyses of the spine using metabolite cycling coupled to a semi-LASER sequences. RESULTS: Macrostructural alterations (decrease in CSA and MTR) were observed in patients at all spinal cord levels studied (C1-T2 for CSA and C1-C5 for MTR) (p < 0.001). Microstructural alterations were observed in the spine and brain on diffusion tensor and fixel-based metrics though the latter showed higher effect sizes. Metabolic alterations were observed in patients as a decreased total N-acetylaspartate/myo-inositol ratio (p < 0.001). Overall, MTR showed the highest effect size. CONCLUSION: This cross-sectional study supports the use of multiparametric techniques that elucidate the structural, microstructural and metabolic alterations in AMN. These outcome measures should be tested longitudinally and in clinical trials.',\n",

       "        'Azoxystrobin (AZ) is a broad-spectrum synthetic fungicide widely used in agriculture globally. However, there are concerns about its fate and effects in the environment. It is reportedly transformed into azoxystrobin acid as a major metabolite by environmental microorganisms. Bacillus licheniformis strain TAB7 is used as a compost deodorant in commercial compost and has been found to degrade some phenolic and agrochemicals compounds. In this article, we report its ability to degrade azoxystrobin by novel degradation pathway. Biotransformation analysis followed by identification by electrospray ionization-mass spectrometry (MS), high-resolution MS, and nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy identified methyl (E)-3-amino-2-(2-((6-(2-cyanophenoxy)pyrimidin-4-yl)oxy)phenyl)acrylate, or (E)-azoxystrobin amine in short, and (Z) isomers of AZ and azoxystrobin amine as the metabolites of (E)-AZ by TAB7. Bioassay testing using Magnaporthe oryzae showed that although 40 mug/mL of (E)-AZ inhibited 59.5 +/- 3.5% of the electron transfer activity between mitochondrial Complexes I and III in M. oryzae, the same concentration of (E)-azoxystrobin amine inhibited only 36.7 +/- 15.1% of the activity, and a concentration of 80 mug/mL was needed for an inhibition rate of 56.8 +/- 7.4%, suggesting that (E)-azoxystrobin amine is less toxic than the parent compound. To our knowledge, this is the first study identifying azoxystrobin amine as a less-toxic metabolite from bacterial AZ degradation and reporting on the enzymatic isomerization of (E)-AZ to (Z)-AZ, to some extent, by TAB7. Although the fate of AZ in the soil microcosm supplemented with TAB7 will be needed, our findings broaden our knowledge of possible AZ biotransformation products.',\n",

       "        'OBJECTIVES: Studies have shown that the consumption of a moderate amount of caffeine is associated with a reduced risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD) and may even be protective against CVD. The purpose of the current study was to evaluate the association between urinary caffeine and its related metabolites and CVD risk in a national representative sample of US adults. METHODS: We analyzed cross-sectional data from the US National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey from 2009 and 2010. The associations between the levels of urinary caffeine metabolites and self-reported CVD, including congestive heart failure, coronary heart disease, angina, heart attack, and stroke, were examined separately in men and women using multivariate logistic regression models adjusted for covariates. RESULTS: In total, 1916 participants (910 men and 1006 women) were included in the analysis. Among women, the odds ratios of CVD in the highest quartiles of 1,3-dimethylxanthine and 1,3,7-trimethylxanthine were 0.33 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.12-0.92) and 0.35 (95% CI, 0.13-0.93), respectively, compared with the lowest quartiles. Each one-unit (micromol/L) increase in theophylline concentration was associated with a 0.24-mg/dL increase in high-density lipoprotein cholesterol in the fully adjusted model. Among men, no significant association was observed between urinary caffeine metabolites and CVD. Regarding the subtypes of CVD, compared with women in the lowest quartile for 1,3-dimethylxanthine and 1,3,7-trimethylxanthine, the odds of coronary heart disease decreased by 90% (95% CI, -99% to -11%) and 97% (95% CI, -99% to -47%), respectively, in those in the highest quartile. CONCLUSIONS: Urinary 1,3-dimethylxanthine and 1,3,7-trimethylxanthine were significantly and inversely associated with CVDs in women. Additional studies are needed to further confirm the results of this study and explore the underlying mechanisms.<END ABSTRACT>.',\n",

       "        \"The antiretroviral nevirapine (NVP) is associated to a reduction of atherosclerotic lesions and increases in high-density lipoprotein (HDL)-cholesterol. Despite being a hepatotoxic drug, which forbids its re-purposing to other therapeutic areas, not all NVP metabolites have the same potential to induce toxicity. Our aim was to investigate the effects of NVP and its metabolites in an exploratory study, towards the identification of a candidate to boost HDL. A pilot prospective (n = 11) and a cross-sectional (n = 332) clinical study were performed with the following endpoints: HDL-cholesterol and apolipoprotein A1 (ApoA1) levels, anti-HDL and anti-ApoA1 antibodies titers, paraoxonase, arylesterase and lactonase activities of paraoxonase-1, and NVP's metabolite profile. NVP treatment increased HDL-cholesterol, ApoA1 and paraoxonase-1 activities, and lowered anti-HDL and anti-ApoA1 titers. In the prospective study, the temporal modulation induced by NVP was different for each HDL-related endpoint. The first observation was a decrease in the anti-HDL antibodies titers. In the cross-sectional study, the lower titers of anti-HDL antibodies were associated to the proportion of 2-hydroxy-NVP (p = 0.03). In vitro models of hepatocytes were employed to clarify the individual contribution of NVP's metabolites for ApoA1 modulation. Long-term incubations of NVP and 2-hydroxy-NVP in the metabolically competent 3D model caused an increase in ApoA1 reaching 43% (p < 0.05) and 86% (p < 0.001), respectively. These results support the contribution of drug biotransformation for NVP-induced HDL modulation, highlighting the role of 2-hydroxy-NVP as ApoA1 booster and its association to lower anti-HDL titers. This biotransformation-guided approach allowed us to identify a non-toxic NVP metabolite as a candidate for targeting HDL.\",\n",

In this present contribution, we demonstrate the activity of the metabolite lupeol, a triterpenoid isolated from the stem bark of Z. monogynum against the harmful effects of the Bothrops alternatus venom. We investigated the antiophidic properties of lupeol, for this purpose, and use crude venom (Pb) incubated with lupeol in different concentrations, testing in vitro experiments and inoculated in mice for inhibitory evaluations in vivo. Besides, we tried to elucidate through the molecular dynamics the mechanism of action of lupeol with the bothropic thrombin-like toxin Jararacussin-I; the acidic phospholipase A2 toxin BthA-I from Bothrops jararacussu and the metalloproteinase toxin BmooMP-I from Bothrops moojeni. In our results, we demonstrated the potential inhibitory effect upon coagulant, phospholipasic and myotoxic activities of the bothropic venom, previously incubated with lupeol. We found that lupeol triterpenoid was able to partially inhibit local and systemic damage caused by snake venom toxins. Our in silico results demonstrate that lupeol is capable of interacting and altering the activity of the thrombin-like toxin Jararacussin-I, and is capable of interacting with the BthA-I acidic PLA2, both toxins present in bothrops snakes venom, thus demonstrating the pharmacological potential of this compound for the treatment of bothropic accidents.',\n",

A post hoc analysis of data collected previously (Kayser et al., 2019a) was conducted to investigate differences in immunologic, physiologic, and behavioral responses of steers (N = 36, initial BW = 386 +/- 24 kg) that had differential haptoglobin (HPT) responses to an experimentally induced challenge with Mannheimia haemolytica (MH). Rumen temperature, DMI, and feeding behavior data were collected continuously, and serial blood samples were collected following the MH challenge. Retrospectively, it was determined that 9 of the 18 MH-challenged steers mounted a minimal HPT response, despite having similar leukocyte and temperature responses to other MH-challenged steers with a greater HPT response. Our objective was to examine differences in behavioral and physiological responses between MH-challenged HPT responsive (RES; n = 9), MH-challenged HPT nonresponsive (NON; n = 9), and phosphate-buffered saline-inoculated controls (CON; n = 18). Additionally, 1H NMR analysis was conducted to determine whether the HPT-responsive phenotype affected serum metabolite profiles. The RES steers had lesser (P < 0.05) cortisol concentrations than NON and CON steers. The magnitude of the increases in neutrophil concentrations and rumen temperature, and the reduction in DMI following the MH challenge were greatest (P < 0.05) in RES steers. Univariate analysis of serum metabolites indicated differences between RES, NON, and CON steers following the MH challenge; however, multivariate analysis revealed no difference between HPT-responsive phenotypes. Prior to the MH challenge, RES steers had longer (P < 0.05) head down and bunk visit durations, slower eating rates (P < 0.01) and greater (P < 0.05) daily variances in bunk visit frequency and head down duration compared with NON steers, suggesting that feeding behavior patterns were associated with the HPT-responsive phenotype. During the 28-d postchallenge period, RES steers had decreased (P < 0.05) final BW, tended (P = 0.06) to have lesser DMI, and had greater (P < 0.05) daily variances in head down and bunk visit durations compared with NON steers, which may have been attributed to their greater acute-phase protein response to the MH challenge. These results indicate that the HPT-responsive phenotype affected feeding behavior patterns and may be associated with disease resiliency in beef cattle.',\n",

Thus, biochemical biomarkers have been used as early-warning tools of biological effects in aquatic organisms. However, before using these markers for environmental monitoring, knowledge about their developmental variation is vital. In this study, we assessed baseline levels and developmental variations of a group of potential biomarkers, oxylipins, during the lifespan of the Northern damselfly (Coenagrion hastulatum) using liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry. Effects of wastewater exposure on baseline levels were studied in a subset of damselflies to investigate the responsiveness due to anthropogenic pollution. Thirty-eight oxylipins deriving from four polyunsaturated fatty acids via two enzymatic pathways were detected in damselflies at three larval stages and in the adult form. Overall, oxylipin baseline levels showed developmental variation, which was lowest in the intermediate larval stages. Effects of exposure to wastewater effluent on oxylipin baseline levels were dependent on the life stage and were greatest in the early and intermediate larval stages. The study provides first insights into oxylipin profiles of damselflies at different stages of development and their developmental variation. Based on our results, we propose further strategies for incorporating oxylipins in damselfly larvae as biochemical markers for anthropogenic pollution.',\n",

OBJECTIVES AND METHODS: We applied liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) based non-targeted metabolomics to determine whether the metabolic profile of serum differs throughout the pregnancy between pre-eclamptic and healthy women in the FINNPEC (Finnish Genetics of Preeclampsia Consortium) Study. Serum samples were available from early and late pregnancy. RESULTS: Progression of pregnancy had large-scale effects to the serum metabolite profile. Altogether 50 identified metabolites increased and 49 metabolites decreased when samples of early pregnancy were compared to samples of late pregnancy. The metabolic signatures of pregnancy were largely shared in pre-eclamptic and healthy women, only urea, monoacylglyceride 18:1 and glycerophosphocholine were identified to be increased in the pre-eclamptic women when compared to healthy controls. CONCLUSIONS: Our study highlights the need of large-scale longitudinal metabolomic studies in non-complicated pregnancies before more detailed understanding of metabolism in adverse outcomes could be provided. Our findings are one of the first steps for a broader metabolic understanding of the physiological changes caused by pregnancy per se.',\n",

       "        'INTRODUCTION: \"Count size\" is a term used to represent the number of shrimps in one pound or kilogram that applies globally in the shrimp industry. Based on shrimp body weight, count sizes range over the smallest (> 70) up to the largest size (U15) of shrimp. Large shrimps are considered highly palatable; therefore, they are priced higher than the small shrimps. However, the pricing of shrimp has not been based on scientific findings since there have been no studies reporting the correlation between shrimp quality and shrimp size. OBJECTIVE: In this study, we aimed to investigate the importance of shrimp size in terms of metabolite profile and sensory properties. METHODS: Nine groups of Litopenaeus vannamei, categorized based on their body weight similarity, were collected from various sampling sites regardless of the difference in days of culture (count size 16/20, 21/25, 26/30, 41/50, and 51/60). Gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (GC/MS)-based metabolomics analysis was employed to characterize their metabolite profiles. Furthermore, a robust PLS regression model was constructed to predict the shrimp size using metabolome data. Following this, the difference in sensory attributes among commercial shrimp count sizes 21/25-41/50 was confirmed using quantitative descriptive analysis (QDA). RESULTS: Small shrimp (> 70-51/60) had higher accumulation of proteinogenic and non-proteinogenic amino acids, sugars, and organic acids compared to large shrimps (41/50-16/20). The QDA of commercial count sizes (21/25-41/50) performed by trained panelists showed that sweetness, juiciness, crispness, and red color attributes increased with an increase in shrimp size. Based on the PLS model, proline as a sweet-tasting metabolite also showed an increased level along with the shrimp size. CONCLUSIONS: These findings demonstrate the importance of shrimp count size with regard to shrimp quality.',\n",

       "        \"BACKGROUND: A processed diet, high in fat and low in fiber, is associated with differences in the gut microbiota and adverse health outcomes in humans; however, little is known about the diet-microbiota relation and its impact on pregnancy. Spontaneous preterm birth (SPTB), a pregnancy outcome with serious short- and long-term consequences, occurs more frequently in black and in obese women in the United States. OBJECTIVES: In a prospective, case-control sample matched for race and obesity (cases = 16, controls = 32), we compared the fecal gut microbiota, fecal and plasma metabolites, and diet in the late second trimester. We hypothesized that a Western diet would be associated with reduced microbiota richness and a metabolic signature predicting incidence of SPTB. METHODS: The fecal microbiota was characterized by 16S-tagged sequencing and untargeted metabolomics was used to analyze both plasma and fecal metabolites. Wilcoxon's rank-sum test was used for the comparison of microbiota genera, alpha-diversity, fecal and plasma metabolites, and dietary variables between term and SPTB. beta-Diversity was analyzed using permutational multivariate ANOVA, and metabolite associations were assessed by module analysis. RESULTS: A decrease in alpha-diversity was strongly associated with the development of SPTB, especially in the taxonomic class of Betaproteobacteria. Of 824 fecal metabolites, 22 metabolites (mostly lipids) differed between cases and controls (P < 0.01), with greater DHA (22:6n-3) and EPA (20:5n-3) in cases [false discovery rate (FDR) < 0.2]. The most significant fecal metabolite module (FDR-adjusted P = 0.008) was dominated by DHA and EPA. Dietary saturated fat (primarily palmitate) intake was greater in cases (31.38 +/- 7.37 compared with 26.08 +/- 8.62 g, P = 0.045) and was positively correlated with fecal DHA and EPA (P < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Reduced alpha-diversity of the gut microbiota and higher excretion of omega-3 (n-3) fatty acids in stool may provide a novel biomarker signature predicting SPTB in women with a low-fiber, high-fat diet. Further investigation of these markers in a larger sample is needed for validation.\",\n",

The oxidation of 6-hydroxypseudooxynicotine to 6-hydroxy-3-succinoyl-semialdehyde-pyridine by 6-hydroxypseudooxynicotine dehydrogenase (Pno) is an important step in the breakdown of the N-heterocycle in this pathway. Although Pno has been characterized, the reaction is not fully understood, i.e., it starts at a high speed, followed by a rapid drop in the reaction rate, leading to the formation of a very small amount of product. In this study, we speculated that an unstable imine intermediate is produced in the reaction, which may be toxic to the metabolism. We found that a Rid protein (designated as Rid-NC) encoded by a gene in the nicotine-degrading gene cluster enhanced the reaction. Rid is a widely distributed family of small proteins with various functions, and some subfamilies have deaminase activity to eliminate the toxicity of the reactive intermediate imine. Biochemical analyses showed that Rid-NC relieved the toxicity of the presumable imine intermediate produced in the Pno reaction, and that, in the presence of Rid-NC, Pno maintained a high activity and the amount of the reaction product was increase by at least 5-fold. Disruption of the rid-NC gene caused a slower growth of strain S33 on nicotine. The mechanism of Rid-NC-mediated detoxification of the imine intermediate was discussed. A phylogenetic analysis indicated that Rid-NC belongs to the rarely studied Rid6 subfamily. These results further our understanding of the biochemical mechanism of nicotine degradation and provide new insights into the function of the Rid6 subfamily proteins.IMPORTANCE Rid is a family of proteins that participate in metabolite-damage repair and is widely distributed in different organisms. In this study, we found that Rid-NC, which belongs to the Rid6 subfamily, promoted the 6-hydroxypseudooxynicotine dehydrogenase (Pno) reaction in the hybrid of the pyridine and pyrrolidine pathways for nicotine degradation by Agrobacterium tumefaciens S33. Rid-NC hydrolyzed the presumable reactive imine intermediate produced in the reaction to remove its toxicity on Pno. The finding furthers our understanding of the metabolic process of the toxic N-heterocyclic aromatic compounds in microorganisms. This study demonstrated that the Rid family of proteins also functions in the metabolism of N-heterocyclic aromatic alkaloids, in addition to the amino acid metabolism, and that Rid6-subfamily proteins also have deaminase activity, similar to RidA subfamily. The ability of reactive imines to damage a non-pyridoxal-5'-phosphate-dependent enzyme was reported. This study provides new insights into the function of the Rid family of proteins.\",\n",

This polymer exhibits morphogenetic as well as antiviral activity and releases metabolic energy after enzymatic hydrolysis also in human cells.

In addition, the production of airway mucus, the first line of body defense, is impaired in those patients. Therefore, in this study, amorphous nanoparticles of the magnesium salt of polyP (Mg-polyP-NP), matching the size of the coronavirus SARS-CoV-2, were prepared and loaded with the secondary plant metabolite quercetin or with dexamethasone to study their effects on the respiratory epithelium using human alveolar basal epithelial A549 cells as a model. The results revealed that both compounds embedded into the polyP nanoparticles significantly increased the steady-state-expression of the MUC5AC gene. This mucin species is the major mucus glycoprotein present in the secreted gel-forming mucus. The level of gene expression caused by quercetin or with dexamethasone, if caged into polyP NP, is significantly higher compared to the individual drugs alone. Both quercetin and dexamethasone did not impair the growth-supporting effect of polyP on A549 cells even at concentrations of quercetin which are cytotoxic for the cells. A possible mechanism of the effects of the two drugs together with polyP on mucin expression is proposed based on the scavenging of free oxygen species and the generation of ADP/ATP from the polyP, which is needed for the organization of the protective mucin-based mucus layer.',\n",

This method does not require sophisticated pulse sequences or specialized radiofrequency and gradient pulses, but rather uses nominally spatially offset slices to produce alternating frequency excitation with simpler slice-selective radiofrequency pulses. Additionally, point-resolved spectroscopy was used to calibrate the (13)C frequency from the thermal proton signal in the target region. This excitation scheme isolates the small [1-(13)C]pyruvate peak from the similar-magnitude tail of the much larger injected [1-(13)C]lactate peak, facilitates quantification of the [1-(13)C]pyruvate signal, simplifies data processing, and could be employed for other substrates and preclinical models.',\n",

Partial least-squares discriminant analysis revealed metabolite profiles were significantly altered by PFOA, involving the primary metabolism (e.g., sucrose, glucose, fructose-6-phosphate, methionine, gamma-aminobutyric acid), and the biosynthesis of (poly)phenol (e.g., shikimate, naringenin) and alkaloid (e.g., geranyl diphosphate, dopamine).

We aimed to evaluate the metabolic profiles of five biofluids (ruminal fluid, serum, milk, urine, and feces) in dairy cow by using proton nuclear magnetic resonance (1H-NMR) and provide a list of metabolites in each biofluid for the benefit of future research. We analyzed the metabolites in five biofluids from lactating cows using proton nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; 96, 73, 88, 118, and 128 metabolites were identified in the five biofluids, respectively. In addition, 8, 6, 9, and 17 metabolites were unique to ruminal fluid, serum, milk, and urine, respectively. The metabolites present at high concentrations were: acetate, propionate, and butyrate in ruminal fluid; lactate, glucose, and acetate in serum; and lactose, guanidoacetate, and glucitol in milk. In addition, the following metabolites were present at high concentrations: hippurate, urea, and trimethylamine N-oxide in urine and acetate, propionate, and butyrate in feces. The score plots of the principal component analysis did not show clear distinctions among the five biofluid samples.

       "        'The physiological response to stressors has great importance, and its variance has an adaptive role in the survival of individuals. This study describes the effects of stress-axis activation on maternal behavior during the birthing process (parturition) in captive rabbits (Oryctolagus cuniculus). In this species, chances of survival are strongly influenced by nest quality. Thus, maternal care is initiated with nest preparation in late pregnancy, which itself is subject to strict and complex hormonal regulation. Among these hormones, progesterone is one of the most dominant in the process of nest construction. We have demonstrated that its level is altered by the level of cortisol elevation in the animal in question, potentially having an influence on the preparation of the nest for the newborn kittens. We found that does that had a constant and un-elevated level of cortisol metabolite while delivering their litters performed better than those individuals that showed an increased corticoid response around parturition. The latter group exhibited a perceptible delay in the building of their nests, and in addition, further losses were also experienced in their already smaller litters. As the quality of the nest itself proved to be was in no way inferior to those of the other group, this higher kitten-mortality rate may be attributed to impaired maternal behavior. Individual variances in cortisol levels may also result in subtle changes in hormonal regulation, potentially affecting the expression of maternal behavior. We have concluded that the higher level of cortisol detected in more-sensitive does effectively disrupts the natural hormonal regulation involved in their nest-building processes.',\n",

A specific solution to this problem may be defined by devising a scoring function, the Maximum Clique problem being a classic example, where S includes all nodes in G and where the score is defined by the size of the largest subset of S fully connected within G. Major practical obstacles for the plethora of algorithms addressing this type of problem include computational efficiency and, particularly for more complex scores which take edge weights into account, the computational cost of permutation testing, a statistical procedure required to obtain a bound on the p-value for a connectedness score. To address these problems, we developed CTD \"Connect the Dots\", a fast algorithm based on data compression that detects highly connected subsets within S. CTD provides information-theoretic upper bounds on p-values when S contains a small fraction of nodes in G without requiring computationally costly permutation testing. We apply the CTD algorithm to interpret multi-metabolite perturbations due to inborn errors of metabolism and multi-transcript perturbations associated with breast cancer in the context of disease-specific Gaussian Markov Random Field networks learned directly from respective molecular profiling data.',\n",

However, there are no studies investigating the efficacy of PGE-MUM as a biomarker for predicting relapse. We investigated whether PGE-MUM can predict clinical relapse of UC. METHODS: The measurement of PGE-MUM and endoscopic evaluation were performed in 70 patients with UC in clinical remission. The optimal cutoff values predicting relapse and relapse-free rate were analyzed. RESULTS: Sixteen patients (22.9%) relapsed during the 12-month follow-up. The median PGE-MUM value of relapsed patients at entry was significantly higher than that of patients in clinical remission (P = 0.008). The cutoff value of PGE-MUM predicting future relapse was 25.2 mug/g Cr by receiver-operating characteristic (ROC) analysis, and the area under the ROC curve was 0.721 (95% confidence interval: 0.556-0.886). The relapse-free rate of patients with PGE-MUM >/=25.2 mug/g Cr was significantly lower than that in patients with PGE-MUM <25.2 mug/g Cr (log-rank test: P < 0.001). The ROC analysis of UC patients with disease duration more than 1-8 years showed that duration of more than 5 years had the largest area under the ROC curve 0.821 (95% confidence interval: 0.583-1.000) and that the optimal cutoff value was 26.3 mug/g Cr.

Among these polyphenols are roburins, which belong to the class of ellagitannins and only occur in oak. To date, water-extracted standardized French Quercus robur wood extract, commercially known as Robuvit((R)), has been investigated in 1172 subjects in over 20 published clinical trials. The results of the clinical studies are consistent with reported effects of urolithins regarding increased mitophagy, pointing to enhanced energy capacity. The Robuvit metabolite urolithin A, B, and C levels and the number of urolithin producers were found to be increased after intake of the extract. Mitophagy is a process, which assigns energy inefficient mitochondria to disassembly, followed by reconstruction to new and more efficient replacements. This effect of Robuvit was observed in different study groups. Supplementation of Robuvit is ascribed to aid chronically fatigued or burnt-out individuals to regain higher energy and activity levels. Robuvit has been further shown to improve conditions such as renal insufficiency, liver insufficiency, mild heart failure, posttraumatic stress disorder and fatigue after surgery and facilitate recovery from mild health impairments such as flu or hangover. There are also indications that Robuvit helps improve erectile function and general loss of vigor in elderly men. Ex vivo gene expression experiments using metabolites collected from Robuvit consumers point to increased ribosomal biogenesis in endothelial, neuronal, and keratinocyte cells. Higher ribosome density accelerates the peptide production to meet protein demand, making Robuvit a potential enhancer of physical endurance and performance. A study with recreational athletes, supplemented with Robuvit daily, reported significantly increased performance in triathlon.',\n",

In order to explore the procedure of flavonol glycosylation in ginseng, 50 UDP-glycosyltransferases (UGTs) were screened out using differentiated data-independent acquisition (DIA) proteomics and phylogenetic analysis. UGT92A10 and UGT94Q4 were found contributing to the formation of kaempferol 3-O-glucoside. UGT73A18, UGT74T4, and UGT75W1 could catalyze galactosylation of kaempferol 3-O-glucoside. Ser278, Trp335, Gln338, and Val339 were found forming hydrogen bonds with UDP-galactose in UGT75W1 by docking.

This prospective cohort study aimed to investigate the association between RA and toluene exposure. METHODS: The study cohort consisted of Korea Occupational Safety and Health Agency data from male workers exposed to toluene who had undergone a toluene-associated special medical examination at least once between January 1, 2000 and December 31, 2004 (n = 148,870). The morbidity from RA based on hospital admission records was estimated from 2000 to 2005 using National Health Insurance Claim Data. The standardized admission ratio (SAR) for RA was calculated with reference to the general population. Levels of urinary hippuric acid (HA), a metabolite of toluene, were measured and used for exposure assessment. RESULTS: Toluene-exposed workers were at an elevated risk of seropositive rheumatoid arthritis (ICD-10 code M05) with an SAR of 2.38 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.14-4.37) and other rheumatoid arthritis (M06) with an SAR of 1.22 (95% CI: 0.91-1.59). When data were stratified according to the duration of toluene exposure and by tertiles of urinary HA level, no significant difference was apparent. CONCLUSION: SARs of the toluene-exposed workers are higher than that of the general reference population, indicating that exposure to toluene may contribute to an increased risk of RA. Further studies of toluene-exposed workers with longer follow-up are needed.',\n",

The urinary concentrations of diesters (DAPs) are usually used as biomarkers to assess human exposure to PFRs. In this study, the PFR and DAP levels were measured in morning and evening urine samples of 30 workers from an e-waste dismantling site in southern China. The indoor dust samples were also collected from workshops and houses for analyzing associations between PFR and DAP levels in urine and dust. Tris(1-chloro-2-propyl) phosphate (TCIPP) and triphenyl phosphate (TPHP) were the dominant PFRs in dust, while bis(2-chloroethyl) phosphate (BCEP) and diphenyl phosphate (DPHP) were the major DAPs in dust. A significant positive correlation was observed between TPHP and DPHP concentrations in dust (p < 0.001), suggesting their potentially same source and the degradation of TPHP to form DPHP. TCIPP and tris(1,3-dichloro-2-propyl) phosphate (TDCIPP) were the predominant PFRs, and BCEP, bis(1,3-dichloro-2-propyl) phosphate (BDCIPP), and DPHP were the main DAPs in both the morning and evening urine samples. The DPHP levels in evening urine samples were significantly correlated with TPHP and DPHP levels (p < 0.01) in dust. A similar correlation was found for the BCEP levels in the evening urine samples and the TCEP and BCEP levels (p < 0.01) in dust. These results indicated that in addition to being biotransformed from their respective parent PFRs, direct ingestion from indoor dust could also be the potential source for urinary DPHP and BCEP. Since relatively low detection frequencies were observed for bis(1-chloro-2-propyl) phosphate (BCIPP) and bis(butoxyethyl) phosphate (BBOEP) in urine, they may not be the major metabolites of TCIPP and tris(2-butoxyethyl) phosphate (TBOEP), respectively, in the human body. However, BDCIPP can be considered a useful biomarker because it is a unique metabolite of TDCIPP and has high detection frequencies in urine samples. The results of this study indicated the limitations of solely using urinary DAPs as biomarkers for the evaluation of human exposure to PFRs, and certain PFRs as well as hydroxylated PFRs (OH-PFRs) should also be considered for urinary biomonitoring in future studies.',\n",

(AAL), from which artemisinin (QHS) is isolated, was found to overcome resistance to QHS. However, the component and metabolite profiles of AAL remain unclear. OBJECTIVES: In this study, component profiling of marker compounds in AAL (amorphane sesquiterpene lactones and flavonoids) was performed, and their subsequent metabolism was investigated in rats. METHODS: For efficient component classification and structural characterization, an improved liquid chromatography tandem high-resolution mass spectrometry (HRMS)-based analytical strategy was applied, i.e., background subtraction (BS) followed by ring-double-bond (RDB) filter in tandem with repeated BS processing. Structures of detected components/metabolites were characterized based on integrated information, including their HRMSn patterns, RDB values, the established component/metabolite network, the biosynthesis pathways of AAL, and/or NMR data. RESULTS: A total of 38 amorphane sesquiterpene lactones and 35 flavonoids were found in AAL as prototype compounds, among which 26 components were previously undescribed. Major compounds were identified by comparing with reference standards. Among 73 AAL prototypes administered, 38 were absorbed in the circulation as the prototype. Moreover, 20 metabolites of amorphane sesquiterpene lactones and 10 metabolites of flavonoids were detected in rats. The major metabolic pathways included oxidation, methylation, glucuronidation, and sulfation. CONCLUSION: The component and metabolite network were established for marker components in AAL, which will be valuable to understand the synergistic antimalarial potency of QHS in A. annua L.

So, our aim was to evaluate whether post-absorptive metabolite and hormone profiles could aid the surgeon decision when considering bariatric surgery interventions. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Subjects (N=38) previously submitted to biliopancreatic diversion with duodenal switch (BPD-DS, n=9), single anastomosis duodenal-ileum bypass with sleeve gastrectomy (SADI-S, n= 9), long biliopancreatic limb Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB-M, n= 11), and classic RYGB (RYGB-C, n= 9) underwent a mixed meal test to evaluate post-absorptive glucose, total amino acid (AA), insulin, and GLP-1 profiles. RESULTS: Glucose, AA, insulin, and GLP-1 excursions were lower after BPD-DS when compared to other surgeries. SADI-S resulted in lower glucose but similar AA and insulin excursions when compared to RYGB-M. The highest GLP-1 excursion was observed after RYGB-M. There were no significant differences in glucose or AA post-prandial excursions between RYGB procedures, yet insulin excursion was higher after RYGB-C when compared to RYGB-M. CONCLUSION: Post-prandial metabolite excursions diverge across bariatric procedures being lowest after BPD-DS, intermediate after SADI-S, and highest after RYGB, in parallel with the anti-diabetic efficacy and malabsorption risk reported for each type of intervention. SADI-S and RYGB-M seem to elicit similar post-prandial hormonal profiles, with potentially lower risk of protein malnutrition when compared to BPD-DS. Post-absorptive metabolite and hormone profiles could provide a rationale as decision-aid when choosing among bariatric surgery interventions, as long as these findings are validated in future trials.',\n",

Results: The analysis results revealed that neCRSwNP, eCRSwNP, and HC exhibited distinctive metabolite signatures.

To investigate the role of RB light in plant growth and GS accumulation, we applied RB light sources with different RB ratios (0:10, 2:8, 5:5, 8:2, and 10:0) to cultivate sprouts. The results showed that significant differential accumulation of GSs existed between sprouts grown under blue (RB, 0:10) and red (RB, 10:0) light; there was greater GS content under blue light. The underlying mechanism of differential GS content in sprouts under red or blue light condition was studied using RNA sequencing technique. Interestingly, abundant GS biosynthetic gene transcripts were observed in sprouts grown under red light compared with under blue light. The expression of beta-glucosidase family homolog genes related to GS degradation differed under red and blue light conditions, among those TGG4 homolog was detected with higher expression under red light than with blue light.

Then the sulfonation of formononetin and excretion of its sulfate were investigated in SULT1A3 overexpressing human embryonic kidney 293 cells (or HKE-SULT1A3 cells) with significant expression of breast cancer resistance protein (BCRP) and multidrug resistance-associated protein 4 (MRP4). As a result, formononetin sulfonation was significantly correlated with SULT1A3 protein levels (r = 0.728; p < 0.05) in a bank of individual human intestine S9 fractions (n = 9). HEK-SULT1A3 cells catalyzed formononetin formation of a monosulfate metabolite. Sulfate formation of formononetin in HEK-SULT1A3 cell lysate followed the Michaelis-Menten kinetics (Vmax = 13.94 pmol/min/mg and Km = 6.17 muM). Reduced activity of MRP4 by MK-571 caused significant decrease in the excretion rate (79.1%-94.6%) and efflux clearance (85.3%-98.0%) of formononetin sulfate, whereas the BCRP specific inhibitor Ko143 had no effect. Furthermore, silencing of MRP4 led to obvious decrease in sulfate excretion rates (>32.8%) and efflux clearance (>50.6%). It was worth noting that the fraction of dose metabolized (fmet), an indicator of the extent of drug sulfonation, was also decreased (maximal 26.7%) with the knockdown of MRP4. In conclusion, SULT1A3 was of great significance in determining sulfonation of formononetin. HEK-SULT1A3 cells catalyzed formononetin formation of a monosulfate. MRP4 mainly contributed to cellular excretion of formononetin sulfate and further mediated the intracellular sulfonation of formononetin.',\n",

However, only one-half to two-thirds of MDD patients respond to SSRI therapy. Recently, a \"multiple omics\" research strategy was applied to identify genetic differences between patients who did and did not respond to SSRI therapy. As a first step, plasma metabolites were assayed using samples from the 803 patients in the PGRN-AMPS SSRI MDD trial. The metabolomics data were then used to \"inform\" genomics by performing a genome-wide association study (GWAS) for plasma concentrations of the metabolite most highly associated with clinical response, serotonin (5-HT). Two genome-wide or near genome-wide significant single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) signals were identified, one that mapped near the TSPAN5 gene and another across the ERICH3 gene, both genes that are highly expressed in the brain. Knocking down TSPAN5 and ERICH3 resulted in decreased 5-HT concentrations in neuroblastoma cell culture media and decreased expression of enzymes involved in 5-HT biosynthesis and metabolism. Functional genomic studies demonstrated that ERICH3 was involved in clathrin-mediated vesicle formation and TSPAN5 was an ethanol-responsive gene that may be a marker for response to acamprosate pharmacotherapy of alcohol use disorder (AUD), a neuropsychiatric disorder highly co-morbid with MDD. In parallel studies, kynurenine was the plasma metabolite most highly associated with MDD symptom severity and application of a metabolomics-informed pharmacogenomics approach identified DEFB1 and AHR as genes associated with variation in plasma kynurenine levels. Both genes also contributed to kynurenine-related inflammatory pathways. Finally, a multiply replicated predictive algorithm for SSRI clinical response with a balanced predictive accuracy of 76% (compared with 56% for clinical data alone) was developed by including the SNPs in TSPAN5, ERICH3, DEFB1 and AHR. In summary, application of a multiple omics research strategy that used metabolomics to inform genomics, followed by functional genomic studies, identified novel genes that influenced monoamine biology and made it possible to develop a predictive algorithm for SSRI clinical outcomes in MDD. A similar pharmaco-omic research strategy might be broadly applicable for the study of other neuropsychiatric diseases and their drug therapy.',\n",

Our results show that metabolite profiles are variable among the investigated lines and that this variation is highly heritable. Second, we identify genes associated with metabolome variation. Third, using the metabolome gave better prediction accuracies than genomic information for four of five quantitative traits analyzed. Our comprehensive characterization of population-scale diversity of metabolomes and its genetic basis illustrates that metabolites have large potential as predictors of organismal phenotypes. This finding is of great importance, e.g., in human medicine, evolutionary biology and animal and plant breeding.',\n",

The frequency of these disorders in patients with compensated Hashimoto's thyroiditis (HT) is unknown. The aim of the present study was to evaluate brain dysfunction in euthyroid HT patients by means of event-related potentials (ERP) and magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) and to correlate it with cognitive function. 68 patients with HT (59 female, 9 male) and 45 healthy controls were included in the study. All the patients underwent ERP including an analysis of N200 and P300 response parameters. MRS voxels were located in the posterior cingulate gyrus (PCG) and the left parietal white matter (PWM). The NAA/Cr, mI/Cr, and Cho/Cr ratios were analysed. The ERP parameters, MRS metabolite ratios and hormonal concentrations (TSH, fT3, fT4) as well as TGAb and TPOAb titer were also correlated. There was a significant prolongation of the latencies of N200 and P300 potentials and a significant decrease of P300 amplitude in HT patients than in the control group. There was a significant positive correlation between the mI/Cr ratio in the PCG area and P300 latencies. NAA/Cr ratio in the PCG region showed significant negative correlations with all N200 latencies. The results may suggest brain dysfunction in neurologically asymptomatic HT patients. ERPs undergo significant changes in patients with HT and may, in combination with MRS, constitute an important element in the recognition and monitoring of cognitive functions in this group of patients.\",\n",

Recent studies have identified the gastrointestinal tract as an important site of action. Here we used intestinal organoids to explore the effects of metformin on intestinal cell physiology. Bulk RNA-sequencing analysis identified changes in hexose metabolism pathways, particularly glycolytic genes. Metformin increased expression of Slc2a1 (GLUT1), decreased expression of Slc2a2 (GLUT2) and Slc5a1 (SGLT1) whilst increasing GLUT-dependent glucose uptake and glycolytic rate as observed by live cell imaging of genetically encoded metabolite sensors and measurement of oxygen consumption and extracellular acidification rates. Metformin caused mitochondrial dysfunction and metformin's effects on 2D-cultures were phenocopied by treatment with rotenone and antimycin-A, including upregulation of GDF15 expression, previously linked to metformin dependent weight loss. Gene expression changes elicited by metformin were replicated in 3D apical-out organoids and distal small intestines of metformin treated mice. We conclude that metformin affects glucose uptake, glycolysis and GDF-15 secretion, likely downstream of the observed mitochondrial dysfunction. This may explain the effects of metformin on intestinal glucose utilisation and food balance.\",\n",

METHODS: We searched PubChem, BATMAN-TCM, Genecards, AD, TTD, String 11.0, AlzData, SwissTargetPrediction, Metascape and other databases for the therapeutic targets of RES and human AD-related targets. The intersection was determined using Venny 2.1 to obtain the therapeutic targets of RES for AD. The protein-protein interaction (PPI) network was constructed, the gene ontology (GO) was enriched and the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes pathway (KEGG pathway) were analyzed. Cytoscape 3.7.1 software was used to construct a target-signaling pathway network of RES in the treatment of AD. Molecular docking verification was carried out on SwissDock (http://www.swissdock.ch/docking). We examined a 293Tau cell model of AD for changes in protein levels of pS396, pS199, Tau5, CDK5, glycogen synthase kinase 3beta (GSK3beta) and p-GSK3beta in response to RES treatment using Western blotting. RESULTS: We obtained 182 targets of RES, 525 targets related to AD, and 36 targets of RES for AD treatment, among which 34.6% of the targets were protein-modifying enzymes, 27.7% were metabolite invertase, 13.8% were gene-specific transcriptional regulators, and 10.3% were transporters. The core key targets of RES in the treatment of AD included INS, APP, ESR1, MMP9, IGF1R, CACNA1C, MAPT (microtubule- associated protein Tau), MMP2, TGFB1 and GSK3B. Enrichment analysis of GO biological process suggested that the biological function of RES in AD treatment mainly involved the response to beta-amyloid protein, positive regulation of transferase activity, the transmembrane receptor protein tyrosine kinase signaling pathway, regulation of behavior, learning or memory, aging, and transmembrane transport. KEGG pathway enrichment analysis showed that the most significantly enriched signaling pathways were AD pathway, PI3K-AKT signaling pathway, cGMP-PKG signaling pathway, and MAPK signaling pathway. Molecular docking results showed that RES had strong binding with ESR1, GSK3B, MMP9, IGF1R, APP and INS. In the cell model of AD, treatment with 50 mumol/L RES for 12 h significantly reduced the levels of pS396 and pS199 by regulating CDK5 and GSK3beta activity (P < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: RES produces therapeutic effects on AD by acting on multiple targets and affecting multiple signaling pathways and improves AD-associated pathologies via a direct action on Abeta and Tau pathological processes.\",\n",

Prebiotics such as galacto-oligosaccharides (GOS) may ameliorate these ageing-related alterations. We aimed to compare the faecal microbiota composition, metabolite production, immune and oxidative stress markers in prefrail elderly and younger adults, and investigate the effects of GOS supplementation in both groups. METHODS: In a randomised controlled cross-over study, 20 prefrail elderly and 24 healthy adults received 21.6 g/day Biotis GOS (containing 15.0 g/day GOS) or placebo. Faecal 16S rRNA gene-based microbiota and short-chain fatty acids were analysed at 0, 1 and 4 weeks of intervention.Volatile organic compounds were analysed in breath, and stimulated cytokine production, CRP, malondialdehyde, trolox equivalent antioxidant capacity (TEAC) and uric acid (UA) in blood at 0 and 4 weeks. RESULTS: Principle coordinate analysis showed differences in microbial composition between elderly and adults (P</=0.05), with elderly having lower bifidobacteria (P</=0.033) at baseline. In both groups, GOS affected microbiota composition (P</=0.05), accompanied by increases in bifidobacteria (P<0.001) and decreased microbial diversity (P</=0.023). Faecal and breath metabolites, immune and oxidative stress markers neither differed between groups (P >/= 0.125) nor were affected by GOS (P >/= 0.236). TEAC values corrected for UA were higher in elderly versus adults (P<0.001), but not different between interventions (P >/= 0.455). CONCLUSIONS: Elderly showed lower faecal bifidobacterial (relative) abundance than adults, which increased after GOS intake in both groups. Faecal and breath metabolites, parameters of immune function and oxidative stress were not different at baseline, and not impacted by GOS supplementation. CLINICALTRIALS.

Moreover, failure of alpha-cells to increase glucagon secretion in response to falling blood glucose concentrations compromises the defense against hypoglycemia, a common complication in diabetes therapy. However, the mechanisms underlying glucose regulation of glucagon secretion are poorly understood and likely involve both alpha-cell-intrinsic and intraislet paracrine signaling. Among paracrine factors, glucose-stimulated release of the GABA metabolite gamma-hydroxybutyric acid (GHB) from pancreatic beta-cells might mediate glucose suppression of glucagon release via GHB receptors on alpha-cells. However, the direct effects of GHB on alpha-cell signaling and glucagon release have not been investigated. Here, we found that GHB (4-10 mum) lacked effects on the cytoplasmic concentrations of the secretion-regulating messengers Ca(2+) and cAMP in mouse alpha-cells. Glucagon secretion from perifused mouse islets was also unaffected by GHB at both 1 and 7 mm glucose. The GHB receptor agonist 3-chloropropanoic acid and the antagonist NCS-382 had no effects on glucagon secretion and did not affect stimulation of secretion induced by a drop in glucose from 7 to 1 mm. Inhibition of endogenous GHB formation with the GABA transaminase inhibitor vigabatrin also failed to influence glucagon secretion at 1 mm glucose and did not prevent the suppressive effect of 7 mm glucose. In human islets, GHB tended to stimulate glucagon secretion at 1 mm glucose, an effect mimicked by 3-chloropropanoic acid. We conclude that GHB does not mediate the inhibitory effect of glucose on glucagon secretion.',\n",

Previously, we demonstrated that lysosomal GBA1 and nonlysosomal GBA2 possess not only GlcCer hydrolase activity, but also transglucosylation activity to transfer the glucose residue from GlcCer to cholesterol to form beta-cholesterylglucoside (beta-GlcChol) in vitro. beta-GlcChol is a member of sterylglycosides present in diverse species. How GBA1 and GBA2 mediate beta-GlcChol metabolism in the brain is unknown. Here, we purified and characterized sterylglycosides from rodent and fish brains. Although glucose is thought to be the sole carbohydrate component of sterylglycosides in vertebrates, structural analysis of rat brain sterylglycosides revealed the presence of galactosylated cholesterol (beta-GalChol), in addition to beta-GlcChol. Analyses of brain tissues from GBA2-deficient mice and GBA1- and/or GBA2-deficient Japanese rice fish (Oryzias latipes) revealed that GBA1 and GBA2 are responsible for beta-GlcChol degradation and formation, respectively, and that both GBA1 and GBA2 are responsible for beta-GalChol formation. Liquid chromatography-tandem MS revealed that beta-GlcChol and beta-GalChol are present throughout development from embryo to adult in the mouse brain. We found that beta-GalChol expression depends on galactosylceramide (GalCer), and developmental onset of beta-GalChol biosynthesis appeared to be during myelination. We also found that beta-GlcChol and beta-GalChol are secreted from neurons and glial cells in association with exosomes. In vitro enzyme assays confirmed that GBA1 and GBA2 have transgalactosylation activity to transfer the galactose residue from GalCer to cholesterol to form beta-GalChol.

While synergistic interactions between the two colonic metabolite groups have been speculated, direct evidence on whether and how these compounds work together towards collective anti-inflammatory effect and gut health remain unclear. In this study, the most important SCFA butyric acid (BtA) and three phenolic metabolites benzoic acid (BzA), phenylacetic acid (PAA) and phenylpropionic acid (PPA) were selected and assessed for the anti-inflammatory effects and the underlying mechanisms in a TNF-alpha-induced Caco-2 cell model. Significantly stronger inhibition of TNF-alpha-induced IL-8 production was found in cells pre-treated with different concentrations of mixtures of BtA and the phenolic metabolites than individual compounds. Further study showed that the synergistic effect was via significant down-regulation of the gene expressions of IL-8, TNF-alpha and VCAM-1, and of phosphorylation of JNK, p38 and IkBalpha, cellular signaling mediators of the MAPK and NF-kappaB pathways. Although these are results of a cell model, they do provide significant insights into the synergistic anti-inflammatory effects between SCFAs and phenolic metabolites.

Here, we utilized metabolomic profiling in an attempt to identify metabolites in the blood plasma and uterine luminal fluids. We collected blood and uterine fluid from repeat breeder and healthy cows on day 7 of the estrous cycle. RESULTS: Metabolomic analysis identified 17 plasma metabolites detected at concentrations that distinguished between the two groups, including decreased various bile acids among the repeat breeders. However, no metabolites that varied significantly were detected in the uterine luminal fluids between two groups. Among the plasma samples, kynurenine was identified as undergoing the most significant variation. Kynurenine is a metabolite produced from tryptophan via the actions of indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase (IDO). As IDO is key for maternal immune tolerance and induced in response to interferon tau (IFNT, ruminant maternal recognition of pregnancy factor), we examined the responsiveness to IFNT on peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) isolated from healthy and repeat breeder cows. The mRNA expression of IFNT-response makers (ISG15 and MX2) were significantly increased by IFNT treatment in a dose-dependent manner in both groups. Although treatment with IFNT promoted the expression of IDO in PBMCs from both groups, it did so at a substantially reduced rate among the repeat breeder cows, suggesting that decreased levels of kynurenine may relate to the reduced IDO expression in repeat breeder cows.

Among all ethnopharmacological applications described for Copaifera spp oleoresins, their anti-inflammatory effect stands out. However, the knowledge of anti-inflammatory and antinociceptive properties of Copaifera pubiflora Benth is scarce. AIM OF THE STUDY: To investigate the cytotoxic, anti-inflammatory, and antinociceptive activities of C. pubiflora oleoresin (CPO), and its major compound ent-hardwickiic acid (HA). MATERIAL AND METHODS: The phosphatase assay was used to evaluate the cytotoxicity of CPO and HA in three different cell lines. CPO and HA doses of 1, 3, and 10 mg/kg were employed in the biological assays. The assessment of motor activity was performed using open-field and rotarod tests. Anti-inflammatory activity of CPO and HA was assessed through luciferase assay, measurement of INF-gamma, IL-1beta, IL-6, IL-10, and TNF-alpha in a multi-spot system with the immortalized cell line THP-1, zymosan-induced arthritis, and carrageenan-induced paw edema. Acetic acid-induced abdominal writhing and formalin tests were undertaken to evaluate the antinociceptive potential of CPO and HA. In addition, the evaluation using carrageenan was performed to investigate the effect of CPO in pain intensity to a mechanical stimulus (mechanical hyperalgesia), using the von Frey filaments. A tail-flick test was used to evaluate possible central CPO and HA actions. RESULTS: In the cytotoxicity evaluation, CPO and HA were not cytotoxic to the cell lines tested. CPO and HA (10 mg/kg) did not affect animals\\' locomotor capacity in both open-field and rotarod tests. In the luciferase assay, CPO and HA significantly reduced luciferase activity (p<0.05). This reduction indicates a decrease in NF-kappaB activity. HA and CPO decreased INF-gamma, IL-1beta, IL-6, IL-10, and TNF-alpha at 24 and 72 h in the multi-spot system. In zymosan-induced arthritis, CPO and HA decreased the number of neutrophils in the joint of arthritic mice and the number of total leukocytes (p<0.05). In experimental arthritis HA significantly decreased joint swelling (p<0.05). CPO and HA also increased the mechanical threshold during experimental arthritis. HA and CPO significantly inhibited the carrageenan-induced paw edema, being the doses of 10 mg/kg the most effective, registering maximum inhibitions of 58 +/- 8% and 76 +/- 6% respectively, p <0.05. CPO and HA reduced the nociceptive behavior in both phases of formalin at all tested doses. The highest doses tested displayed inhibitions of 87 +/- 1% and 72 +/- 4%, respectively, p < 0.001, in the first phase, and 87 +/- 1% and 81 +/- 2%, respectively, p < 0.001, in the second phase. Oral treatment of CPO and HA (1, 3, 10 mg/kg) significantly reduced the nociceptive response in acetic acid-induced abdominal writhings, and the 10 mg/kg dose was the most effective with maximum inhibitions of 86 +/- 2% and 82 +/- 1%, respectively, p<0.001. Both HA and CPO significantly decreased the intensity of mechanical inflammatory hyper-nociception on carrageenan-induced hyperalgesia at all tested doses, and 10 mg/kg was the most effective dose with maximum inhibitions of 73 +/- 5% and 74 +/- 7%, respectively, p <0.05.CPO increased the tail-flick latencies in mice, and concomitant administration of naloxone partially reduced its effect.

While tamoxifen continues to be successfully used to treat estrogen-dependent breast cancer, most patients receiving treatment will develop chemoresistance over time. Two commonly reported biomarkers of tamoxifen resistance are decreased expression of insulin-like growth factor 1 receptor (IGF-1R) and increased expression of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR). In prior work we have shown that these receptors facilitate chemoresistance and have unique regulatory functions measurable in resistant cell lines compared with nonresistant. Thus, we hypothesized that these receptors and a newly identified biomarker, integrin beta1, may be used to search for the presence of resistant breast cancer cells within a population of cells that are sensitive to tamoxifen therapy. We tested this by designing a straightforward cell-labeling approach to measure differences in the receptor expression of resistant vs. sensitive cells cytometrically. Our results show that separation is possible when observing the expression of IGF-1R as well as integrin beta1. Interestingly, we found no detectable difference in EGFR expression between tamoxifen resistant and -sensitive cells when measured with cytometry despite the fact that EGFR is upregulated in resistant cells. Our long-term goal is to utilize sorting to isolate tamoxifen resistant subpopulations of cells by receptor expression level. Isolating rare resistant cells that reside within a population of drug-sensitive cells will offer new insights into why chemoresistance occurs.',\n",

It is now well established that most of the second generation drugs cause metabolic side-effects. Risperidone and its active metabolite paliperidone (9-hydroxyrisperidone) are two commonly used antipsychotic drugs with moderate metabolic liability. However, there is a dearth of preclinical data that directly compares the metabolic effects of these two drugs, using sophisticated experimental procedures. The goal of the present study was to compare metabolic effects for each drug versus control animals. METHODS: Adult female rats were acutely treated with either risperidone (0.1, 0.5, 1, 2, 6 mg/kg), paliperidone (0.1, 0.5, 1, 2, 6 mg/kg) or vehicle and subjected to the glucose tolerance test; plasma was collected to measure insulin levels to measure insulin resistance with HOMA-IR. Separate groups of rats were treated with either risperidone (1, 6 mg/kg), paliperidone (1, 6 mg/kg) or vehicle, and subjected to the hyperinsulinemic euglycemic clamp. RESULTS: Fasting glucose levels were increased by all but the lowest dose of risperidone, but only with the highest dose of paliperidone. HOMA-IR increased for both drugs with all but the lowest dose, while the three highest doses decreased glucose tolerance for both drugs. Risperidone and paliperidone both exhibited dose-dependent decreases in the glucose infusion rate in the clamp, reflecting pronounced insulin resistance.

Mathematical models informed by spatially and temporally distributed neuroimage data are becoming instrumental for reconstructing a coherent picture of normal and pathological oxygen delivery throughout the brain. Unfortunately, current mathematical models of cerebral blood flow and oxygen exchange become excessively large in size. They further suffer from boundary effects due to incomplete or physiologically inaccurate computational domains, numerical instabilities due to enormous length scale differences, and convergence problems associated with condition number deterioration at fine mesh resolutions. Our proposed simple finite volume discretization scheme for blood and oxygen microperfusion simulations does not require expensive mesh generation leading to the critical benefit that it drastically reduces matrix size and bandwidth of the coupled oxygen transfer problem. The compact problem formulation yields rapid and stable convergence. Moreover, boundary effects can effectively be suppressed by generating very large replica of the cortical microcirculation in silico using an image-based cerebrovascular network synthesis algorithm, so that boundaries of the perfusion simulations are far removed from the regions of interest. Massive simulations over sizeable portions of the cortex with feature resolution down to the micron scale become tractable with even modest computer resources. The feasibility and accuracy of the novel method is demonstrated and validated with in vivo oxygen perfusion data in cohorts of young and aged mice. Our oxygen exchange simulations quantify steep gradients near penetrating blood vessels and point towards pathological changes that might cause neurodegeneration in aged brains. This research aims to explain mechanistic interactions between anatomical structures and how they might change in diseases or with age. Rigorous quantification of age-related changes is of significant interest because it might aide in the search for imaging biomarkers for dementia and Alzheimer's disease.\",\n",

The biliary docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) containing NAT, C22:6 NAT, was increased in human and mouse plasma after dietary omega-3 fatty acid supplementation and potently inhibited intestinal triacylglycerol hydrolysis and lipid absorption. Supporting this observation, genetic elevation of endogenous NAT levels in mice impaired lipid absorption, while selective augmentation of C22:6 NAT levels protected against hypertriglyceridemia and fatty liver. When administered pharmacologically, C22:6 NAT accumulated in bile and reduced high fat diet-induced, but not sucrose-induced, hepatic lipid accumulation in mice, suggesting that C22:6 NAT was a negative feedback mediator that limited excess intestinal lipid absorption. Thus, biliary omega-3 NATs may contribute to the hypotriglyceridemic mechanism of action of fish oil and could influence the design of more potent omega-3 fatty acid-based therapeutics.',\n",

       "        'PURPOSE: The starting dose of sunitinib in children with gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GIST) was extrapolated based on data in adults with GIST or solid tumors and children with solid tumors. METHODS: Integrated population pharmacokinetics (PK), PK/pharmacodynamics (PD), and exposure-response analyses using nonlinear mixed-effects modeling approaches were performed to extrapolate PK and PD of sunitinib in children with GIST at projected dose(s) with plasma drug exposures comparable to 50-mg/day in adults with GIST. The analysis datasets included PK/PD data in adults with GIST and adults and children with solid tumors. The effect of covariates on PK and safety/efficacy endpoints were explored. RESULTS: Two-compartment models with lag time were successfully used to describe the PK of sunitinib and its active metabolite SU012662. PK/PD models were successfully built to describe key continuous safety and efficacy endpoints. The effect of age on sunitinib apparent clearance (CL/F) and body surface area on SU012662 CL/F was statistically significant (P </= 0.001): children who were younger or of smaller body size had lower CL/F; however, age and body size did not appear to negatively affect safety or efficacy response to plasma drug exposure. CONCLUSION: Based on PK, safety, and efficacy trial simulations, a sunitinib starting dose of ~ 25 mg/m(2)/day was predicted to provide comparable plasma drug exposures in children with GIST as in adults with GIST treated with 50 mg/day. However, in the absence of a tumor type effect of sunitinib on CL/F in children, the projected equivalent dose for this population would be ~ 20 mg/m(2)/day.',\n",

       "        'Cholesterol, the principal zoosterol, is a key metabolite linked to several health complications. Studies have shown its potential as a metabolic biomarker for predicting various diseases and determining food origin. However, the existing INEPT (insensitive nuclei enhanced by polarization transfer) (13)C position-specific isotope analysis method of cholesterol by NMR was not suitable for very precise analysis of small quantities due to its long acquisition time and therefore is restricted to products rich in cholesterol. In this work, a symmetric and adiabatic heteronuclear single quantum coherence (HSQC) 2D NMR sequence was developed for the high-precision (few permil) analysis of small quantities of cholesterol. Adiabatic pulses were incremented for improving precision and sensitivity. Moreover, several strategies such as the use of non-uniform sampling, linear prediction, and variable recycling time were optimized to reduce the acquisition time. The number of increments and spectral range were also adjusted. The method was developed on a system with a cryogenically cooled probe and was not tested on a room-temperature system. Our new approach allowed analyzing as low as 5 mg of cholesterol in 31 min with a long-term repeatability lower than 2 per thousand on the 24 non-quaternary carbon atoms of the molecule comparing to 16.2 h for the same quantity using the existing INEPT method. This result makes conceivable the isotope analysis of matrices low in cholesterol. Graphical abstract.',\n",

       "        'Background Alflutinib is a novel irreversible and highly selective third-generation EGFR inhibitor currently being developed for the treatment of non-small cell lung cancer patients with activating EGFR mutations and EGFR T790M drug-resistant mutation. Alflutinib is mainly metabolized via CYP3A4 to form its active metabolite AST5902. Both alflutinib and AST5902 contribute to the in vivo pharmacological activity. The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of rifampicin (a strong CYP3A4 inducer) on the pharmacokinetics of alflutinib and AST5902 in healthy volunteers, thus providing important information for drug-drug interaction evaluation and guiding clinical usage. Methods This study was designed as a single-center, open-label, and single-sequence trial over two periods. The volunteers received a single dose of 80 mg alflutinib on Day 1/22 and continuous doses of 0.6 g rifampicin on Day 15-30. Blood sampling was conducted on Day 1-10 and Day 22-31. The pharmacokinetics of alflutinib, AST5902, and the total active ingredients (alflutinib and AST5902) with or without rifampicin co-administration were respectively analyzed. Results Co-administration with rifampicin led to 86% and 60% decreases in alflutinib AUC0-infinity and Cmax, respectively, as well as 17% decrease in AST5902 AUC0-infinity and 1.09-fold increase in AST5902 Cmax. The total active ingredients (alflutinib and AST5902) exhibited 62% and 39% decreases in AUC0-infinity and Cmax, respectively. Conclusions As a strong CYP3A4 inducer, rifampicin exerted significant effects on the pharmacokinetics of alflutinib and the total active ingredients (alflutinib and AST5902). The results suggested that concomitant strong CYP3A4 inducers should be avoided during alflutinib treatment. This trial was registered at http://www.chinadrugtrials.org.cn .

Although much progress has been made in understanding the permeability properties of peroxisomes, there are still important gaps in our knowledge about the peroxisomal transport of metabolites and cofactors. In this review, we discuss the different modes of transport of metabolites and essential cofactors, including CoA, NAD(+), NADP(+), FAD, FMN, ATP, heme, pyridoxal phosphate, and thiamine pyrophosphate across the peroxisomal membrane. This transport can be mediated by non-selective pore-forming proteins, selective transport proteins, membrane contact sites between organelles, and co-import of cofactors with proteins. We also discuss modes of transport mediated by shuttle systems described for NAD(+)/NADH and NADP(+)/NADPH.

       "        'Breast cancer is the most common cancer among women worldwide. Overweight and obesity are now recognized as established risk factors for this pathology in postmenopausal women. These conditions are also believed to be responsible for higher recurrence and mortality rates. Reciprocal interactions have been described between adipose and cancer cells. An adipose microenvironment favors a greater proliferation of cancer cells, their invasion and even resistance to anti-cancer treatments. In addition, the chronic low-grade inflammation observed in obese individuals is believed to amplify these processes. Among the cell types present in the breast, myoepithelial cells (MECs), located at the interface of the epithelial cells and the stroma, are considered \"tumor suppressor\" cells. During the transition from ductal carcinoma in situ to invasive cancer, disorganization or even the disappearance of MECs is observed, thereby enhancing the ability of the cancer cells to migrate. As the adipose microenvironment is now considered as a central actor in the progression of breast cancer, our objective was to evaluate if it could be involved in MEC functional modifications, leading to the transition of in situ to invasive carcinoma, particularly in obese patients. Through a co-culture model, we investigated the impact of human adipose stem cells from women of normal weight and obese women, differentiated or not into mature adipocytes, on the functionality of the MECs by measuring changes in viability, apoptosis, gene, and miRNA expressions. We found that adipose cells (precursors and differentiated adipocytes) could decrease the viability of the MECs, regardless of the original BMI. The adipose cells could also disrupt the expression of the genes involved in the maintenance of the extracellular matrix and to amplify the expression of leptin and inflammatory markers. miR-122-5p and miR-132-3p could also be considered as targets for adipose cells. The metabolite analyses revealed specific profiles that may be involved in the growth of neoplastic cells. All of these perturbations could thus be responsible for the loss of tumor suppressor status of MECs and promote the transition from in situ to invasive carcinoma.',\n",

The critical needs in oral cancer treatment are expanding our knowledge of malignant tumour progression and the development of useful approaches to prevent dysplastic lesions. This study was designed to gain insights into the underlying metabolic transformations that occur during the process of oral carcinogenesis. Methods: We used gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) in conjunction with multivariate statistical techniques to observe alterations in serum metabolites in a 4-Nitroquinoline 1-oxide (4NQO)-induced rat tongue carcinogenesis model. Thirty-eight male rats were randomly divided into two groups, including the 4NQO-induced model group of 30 rats and the healthy control group of five rats. Animals were sacrificed at weeks 9, 13, 20, 24, and 32, post-4NQO treatment. Tissue samples were collected for histopathological examinations and blood samples were collected for metabolomic analysis. Partial least squares discriminate analysis (PLS-DA) models generated from GC-MS metabolic profile data showed robust discrimination from rats with oral premalignant and malignant lesions induced by 4NQO, and normal controls. Results: The results found 16 metabolites associated with 4NQO-induced rat tongue carcinogenesis. Dysregulated arachidonic acid, fatty acid, and glycine metabolism, as well as disturbed tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle and mitochondrial respiratory chains were observed in the animal model. The PLS-DA models of metabolomic results demonstrated good separations between the 4NQO-induced model group and the normal control group.

Research interest in these specialized metabolites lies in their natural occurrence and therapeutic activities. Nonetheless, research progress has thus far been hindered by the lack of analytical standards and analytical methods for both qualitative and quantitative analysis. We report here that various parts of Ventilago harmandiana are rich sources of PNQs. We developed an ultraperformance liquid chromatography-electrospray ionization multiple reaction monitoring/mass spectrometry method to quantitatively determine six PNQs from leaves, root, bark, wood, and heartwood. The addition of standards in combination with a stable isotope of salicylic acid-D6 was used to overcome the matrix effect with average recovery of 82% +/- 1% (n = 15). The highest concentration of the total PNQs was found in the root (11,902 mug/g dry weight), whereas the lowest concentration was found in the leaves (28 mug/g dry weight). Except for the root, PNQ-332 was found to be the major compound in all parts of V. harmandiana, accounting for approximately 48% of the total PNQs quantified in this study. However, PNQ-318A was the most abundant PNQ in the root sample, accounting for 27% of the total PNQs. Finally, we provide novel MS/MS spectra of the PNQs at different collision induction energies: 10, 20, and 40 eV (POS and NEG). For structural elucidation purposes, we propose complete MS/MS fragmentation pathways of PNQs using MS/MS spectra at collision energies of 20 and 40 eV. The MS/MS spectra along with our discussion on structural elucidation of these PNQs should be very useful to the natural products community to further exploring PNQs in V. harmandiana and various other sources.',\n",

The different starter culture mixtures applied effectively steered the cocoa fermentation processes performed. Moreover, the use of an amplicon sequence variant (ASV) approach, aligning these ASVs to the whole-genome sequences of the inoculated strains, allowed the monitoring of these inoculated strains and their differentiation from very closely related variants naturally present in the background or spontaneous fermentation processes. Further, traits such as malolactic fermentation during the fermentation step and acetoin and tetramethylpyrazine formation during the drying step could be unraveled. Finally, the yeast strains inoculated influenced the substrate consumption and metabolite production during all starter culture-initiated fermentation processes. This had an impact on the VOC profiles of the cured cocoa beans. Whereas the P. kudriavzevii strain produced a wide range of VOCs in the cocoa pulp, the S. cerevisiae strain mostly influenced the VOC composition of the cured cocoa beans.',\n",

Although microbiome-metabolome associations have been well characterized and could be used as indicators of wine quality, the impact of regionality on the microbiome and metabolome is not well known. Additionally, studies between microbiome and metabolome have been conducted on single species grape such as Vitis vinifera instead of other species and interspecific hybrids. Although the Pennsylvania wine industry is relatively young compared to California, the industry has been experiencing rapid growth over the past decade and is expected to continue to grow in the future. Pennsylvania's climate of cold winters and high levels of rainfall throughout the growing season favors cultivation of interspecific hybrid grapes such as Vitis ssp. Chambourcin, one of the most commonly grown hybrid varieties in the state. Chambourcin is a prime candidate for studying the impact of regionality on microbiome-metabolome interactions as interspecific hybrid varieties could shape the future of winemaking. Here, we identify for the first time the regional distribution of microbial communities and their interactions with volatile metabolome during fermentation (0-20 days) by integrating high throughput Illumina sequencing (16S and ITS) and headspace-solid phase microextraction-gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. Analyzing 88 samples from nine wineries in the Central and East Pennsylvania regions, we observed high microbial diversity during early stages of fermentation (1-4 days) where non-Saccharomyces yeasts such as Starmerella and Aureobasidium and non-Oenococcus bacteria, Sphingomonas, likely contribute to microbial terroir to the resulting wines. Furthermore, key differentiators between two regions in Pennsylvania, as identified by LEfSe analysis, include the fungal genera Cladosporium and Kazachstania and the bacterial genera Lactococcus and Microbacterium. Moreover, 29 volatile fermentation metabolites were discriminated significantly (variable importance in projection > 1) between the two regions as shown by Partial Least Squares-Discriminant Analysis. Finally, Spearman's correlation identified regional differences of microbial-metabolite associations throughout fermentation that could be used for targeted microbiome manipulation to improve wine quality and preserve regionality. In summary, these results demonstrate the microbial signatures during fermentation and differential microorganisms and metabolites further support impact of regionality on Chambourcin wines in Pennsylvania.\",\n",

Methods: 16S/ITS sequences and metabolite spectra were obtained by high-throughput amplicon sequencing and ultra-high-performance liquid chromatography-high-resolution mass spectrometry, respectively. Changes in the diversity of the endophytic microbial community and metabolites were studied, and the effect of T. macropoda leaf spots on photosynthesis was examined by chlorophyll fluorescence.

In the T-maze task, progesterone administration to wild-type and PRKO mice had significantly greater number of spontaneous alternations compared to their vehicle-administered counterparts. In the water maze task, PRKO mice administered vehicle spent significantly fewer seconds in the quadrant associated with the escape platform on testing compared to all other groups. Experiment 2: Progesterone administered to wild-type and PRKO mice increased plasma progesterone and allopregnanolone levels (n = 5/group). PRKO mice had higher allopregnanolone levels in plasma and hippocampus, but not cortex, when administered progesterone and compared to wild-type mice.

Wild-type as well as PRKO mice administered progesterone experienced significant increases in maximal GABAA agonist, muscimol, binding in hippocampus and cortex, compared to their vehicle-administered counterparts.

Using data from a prospective pre-birth cohort, we aimed to further understand the prenatal determinants of fetal metabolic programming based on analyses of maternal adiposity and glycemic traits across pregnancy with childhood metabolomic profiles. METHODS: This study included 330 mother-child pairs from the Gen3G cohort with information on maternal adiposity and glycemic markers at 5-16 (visit 1) and 24-30 (visit 2) weeks of pregnancy. At mid-childhood (4.8-7.2 years old), we collected fasting plasma and measured 1116 metabolites using an untargeted approach. We constructed networks of interconnected metabolites using a weighted-correlation network analysis algorithm. We estimated Spearman's partial correlation coefficients of maternal adiposity and glycemic traits across pregnancy with metabolite networks and individual metabolites, adjusting for maternal age, gravidity, race/ethnicity, history of smoking, and child's sex and age at blood collection for metabolite measurement. RESULTS: We identified a network of 16 metabolites, primarily glycero-3-phosphoethanolamines (GPE) at mid-childhood that showed consistent negative correlations with maternal body mass index, waist circumference, and body-fat percentage at visits 1 and 2 (rhoadjusted = -0.14 to -0.21) and post-challenge glucose levels at visit 2 (rhoadjusted = -0.10 to -0.13), while positive correlations with Matsuda index (rhoadjusted = 0.13).

Such advances prompt the definition of reference values and degree of interindividual variability for these metabolites at different levels of alpha-TOH intake. To this end, a one-week oral administration protocol with 800 U RRR-alpha-TOH/day was performed in 17 healthy volunteers, and alpha-TOH metabolites were measured in plasma before and at the end of the intervention utilizing a recently validated LC-MS/MS procedure; the expression of two target genes of alpha-TOH with possible a role in the metabolism and function of this vitamin, namely pregnane X receptor (PXR) and the isoform 4F2 of cytochrome P450 (CYP4F2) was assessed by immunoblot in peripheral blood leukocytes. The levels of enzymatic metabolites showed marked interindividual variability that characteristically increased upon supplementation. With the exception of alpha-CEHC (carboxy-ethyl-hydroxychroman) and the long-chain metabolites M1 and alpha-13\\'OH, such variability was found to interfere with the possibility to utilize them as sensitive indicators of alpha-TOH intake.

The aim of the present study was to investigate the effect of oleuropein alone (20 mug/mL) and in co-treatment with ADR (50 nM), in MG-63 human osteosarcoma cells. Therefore, cellular and molecular techniques, such as MTT assay, flow cytometry, real-time Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR), western blot and Elisa method, as well as Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) spectroscopy, were applied to unveil changes in the signal transduction pathways involved in osteosarcoma cells survival. The observed alterations in gene, protein and metabolite levels denote that OLEU not only inhibits MG-63 cells proliferation and potentiates ADR's cytotoxicity, but also exerts its action, at least in part, through the induction of autophagy.\",\n",

Existing methods for STEC detection and isolation are time-consuming. Rapid methods may assist in preventing contaminated products from reaching consumers. This proof-of-concept study aimed to determine if a metabolomics approach could be used to detect STEC contamination in spinach. Using untargeted metabolic profiling, the bacterial pellets and supernatants arising from bacterial and inoculated spinach enrichments were investigated for the presence of unique metabolites that enabled categorization of three E. coli risk groups. A total of 109 and 471 metabolite features were identified in bacterial and inoculated spinach enrichments, respectively. Supervised OPLS-DA analysis demonstrated clear discrimination between bacterial enrichments containing different risk groups. Further analysis of the spinach enrichments determined that pathogen risk groups 1 and 2 could be easily discriminated from the other groups, though some clustering of risk groups 1 and 2 was observed, likely representing their genomic similarity. Biomarker discovery identified metabolites that were significantly associated with risk groups and may be appropriate targets for potential biosensor development.

Discrepancies and variations in 3-T1AM plasma and tissue concentrations have nonetheless caused controversy regarding the existence and biological role of 3-T1AM. These discussions are at least partially based on potential analytical artefacts caused by differential decay kinetics of 3-T1AM and the widely used deuterated quantification standard D4-T1AM. Here, we report a novel LC-MS/MS method for the quantification of 3-T1AM in biological specimens using stable isotope dilution with (13)C6-T1AM, a new internal standard that showed pharmacodynamic properties comparable to endogenous 3-T1AM. The method detection limit (MDL) and method quantification limit (MQL) of 3-T1AM were 0.04 and 0.09 ng/g, respectively. The spike-recoveries of 3-T1AM were between 85.4% and 94.3%, with a coefficient of variation of 3.7-5.8%. The intra-day and inter-day variations of 3-T1AM were 8.45-11.2% and 3.58-5.73%, respectively. Endogenous 3-T1AM liver values in C57BL/6J mice were 2.20 +/- 0.49 pmol/g with a detection frequency of 50%. Higher liver 3-T1AM values were found when C57BL/6J mice were treated with N-acetyl-3-iodothyronamine or O-acetyl-3-iodothyronamine. Overall, our new stable isotope dilution LC-MS/MS method improves both the sensitivity and selectivity compared with existing methods. The concomitant possibility to quantify additional thyroid hormones such as thyroxine, 3,5,3'-triiodo-L-thyronine, 3,3',5'-triiodo-L-thyronine, 3,3'-diiodo-L-thyronine, and 3,5-diiodo-L-thyronine further adds to the value of our novel method in exploring the natural occurrence and fate of 3-T1AM in biological tissues and fluids.\",\n",

Omega-3 and omega-6 fatty acids can be converted into bioactive epoxides by cytochrome P450s (CYP450), which play pro-resolving roles in the inflammatory response; however, soluble epoxide hydrolase (sEH) metabolizes epoxides into diols, which lack pro-resolving functions and can be cytotoxic. Here, we survey serum CYP450- and sEH-derived metabolite concentrations in people with T2DM with and without a major depressive episode. METHODS: Sunnybrook Type 2 Diabetes Study (NCT04455867) participants experiencing a major depressive episode (research version of the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-5 criteria) were matched 1:1 for gender, glycosylated hemoglobin A1c and body mass index to participants without a current depressive episode. Depression severity was assessed using the Beck Depression Inventory 2nd Edition (BDI-II). From fasting morning blood, unesterified serum oxylipins were quantified by ultra-high-performance liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry following solid phase extraction, and interleukin-6 (IL-6) by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. RESULTS: Between 20 depressed and 20 non-depressed participants (mean age 58.9 +/- 8.5 years, 65% women) with T2DM, several sEH-derived fatty acid diols, but not IL-6, were higher among those with a depressive episode (effect sizes up to d = 0.796 for 17,18-DiHETE, a metabolite of eicosapentaenoic acid [EPA]; t = 2.516, p = 0.016). Among people with a depressive episode, two epoxides were correlated with lower BDI-II scores: 12(13)-EpOME (rho = -0.541, p = 0.014) and 10(11)-EpDPE (rho = -0.444, p = 0.049), metabolites of linoleic acid and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), respectively, while the ratio of 12,13-DiHOME/12(13)-EpOME was correlated with higher BDI-II scores (rho = 0.513, p = 0.021).

The Slow Loris Conservation Center was built at the Japan Monkey Center to enhance the welfare of confiscated slow lorises, promote their conservation, improve public education, and perform scientific research on the species. In the course of improving housing conditions, several same-sex pairs of pygmy slow lorises were formed. We monitored their behaviors and fecal glucocorticoid metabolite (FGM) levels to understand whether male same-sex pairings could be a feasible management strategy. The subjects were 10 male and 6 female lorises for comparison, all of whom were over 5 years old. We successfully formed five pairs of male lorises after eight formation attempts. Male pairs initially showed some aggressive behaviors; however, the rate decreased approximately 10 days after introduction. All of the male pairs eventually exhibited extensive affiliative social behaviors, including allogrooming and social play, during the dark (active) phase, and sleep site sharing during the light (inactive) phase. The rate of sleep site sharing during the light phase was higher than expected, suggesting that the pairs preferred to stay near each other. There was no evidence of increased stress after a long period of male-male social housing. Female same-sex pairs and male-female pairs demonstrated a high level of affiliative behaviors right after the introduction. These results highlight the flexibility and high sociability of this species and indicate that such same-sex pairings are a feasible option for their social management.',\n",

Lipid mediators play critical role in progression of colitis and colitis-associated colon cancer (CAC) and some of their metabolites are excreted in urine. Here, we attempted to find novel biomarkers in urinary lipid metabolite of a murine model of CAC. Mice were received single administration of azoxymethane (AOM) and repeated administration of dextran sulfate sodium (DSS). Lipid metabolites in their urine was measured by liquid chromatography mass spectrometry and their colon was collected to perform morphological study.

The use of appropriate references in analytical chemistry, such as certified reference materials (CRMs) of high purity substances, is one of the required procedures to obtain traceable measurements. When commercial standards with non-certified purity values are used, traceability must be achieved by determining the purity of the standard using a potential primary reference measurement procedure or other appropriate methods. Quantitative nuclear magnetic resonance (qNMR) is a technique with the potential to be used in primary measurement procedures.

The less selective PET ligand [(11)C]flumazenil has revealed reductions in GABAA receptors. The hypothesis that alpha5 subunit receptor alterations are present in temporal lobe epilepsy and could contribute to impaired memory is untested. We compared alpha5 subunit availability between individuals with temporal lobe epilepsy and normal structural MRI ('MRI-negative') and healthy controls, and interrogated the relationship between alpha5 subunit availability and episodic memory performance, in a cross-sectional study. Twenty-three healthy male controls (median +/- interquartile age 49 +/- 13 years) and 11 individuals with MRI-negative temporal lobe epilepsy (seven males; 40 +/- 8) had a 90-min PET scan after bolus injection of [(11)C]Ro15-4513, with arterial blood sampling and metabolite correction. All those with epilepsy and six controls completed the Adult Memory and Information Processing Battery on the scanning day. 'Bandpass' exponential spectral analyses were used to calculate volumes of distribution separately for the fast component [V F; dominated by signal from alpha1 (alpha2, alpha3)-containing receptors] and the slow component (V S; dominated by signal from alpha5-containing receptors). We made voxel-by-voxel comparisons between: the epilepsy and control groups; each individual case versus the controls. We obtained parametric maps of V F and V S measures from a single bolus injection of [(11)C]Ro15-4513. The epilepsy group had higher V S in anterior medial and lateral aspects of the temporal lobes, the anterior cingulate gyri, the presumed area tempestas (piriform cortex) and the insulae, in addition to increases of approximately 24% and approximately 26% in the ipsilateral and contralateral hippocampal areas (P < 0.004). This was associated with reduced V F:V S ratios within the same areas (P < 0.009). Comparisons of V S for each individual with epilepsy versus controls did not consistently lateralize the epileptogenic lobe. Memory scores were significantly lower in the epilepsy group than in controls (mean +/- standard deviation -0.4 +/- 1.0 versus 0.7 +/- 0.3; P = 0.02). In individuals with epilepsy, hippocampal V S did not correlate with memory performance on the Adult Memory and Information Processing Battery. They had reduced V F in the hippocampal area, which was significant ipsilaterally (P = 0.03), as expected from [(11)C]flumazenil studies. We found increased tonic inhibitory neurotransmission in our cohort of MRI-negative temporal lobe epilepsy who also had co-morbid memory impairments.

Objective: We aimed to investigate the associations between plasma TMAO concentrations and its precursors [carnitine, choline, betaine, and dimethylglycine (DMG)] with metabolic syndrome (MetS) scores, preclinical cardiovascular phenotypes, and inflammatory biomarkers (i.e. high-sensitivity C-reactive protein and serum glycoprotein acetyls) in a population-derived cohort of children and their parents. Methods: The concentrations of TMAO and its precursors were quantified using UHPLC coupled with tandem MS (UHPLC/MS-MS) in 1166 children (mean age 11 y +/- 0.5 y, 51% female) and 1324 adults (44 y +/- 5.1 y, 87% female) participating in The Growing Up in Australia's Child Health CheckPoint Study. We developed multivariable fractional polynomial models to analyze associations between TMAO, its precursors, MetS (adjusted for sex and age), and cardiovascular phenotypes (adjusted for sex, age, BMI, household income, and the urinary albumin to creatinine ratio). Pearson's correlations were computed to identify associations between TMAO, its precursors, and inflammatory biomarkers. Results: The concentrations of TMAO precursors, but not TMAO itself, were associated with MetS, cardiovascular phenotypes, and inflammatory biomarkers in children and adults. Conclusions: TMAO precursors, but not TMAO itself, were associated with adverse cardiometabolic and inflammatory phenotypes in children and adults. TMAO precursor concentrations may better reflect cardiovascular health and inflammatory status within the wider population.

Current treatments for silicosis have highly limited availability (i.e., lung transplantation) or, do not effectively prolong patient survival time (i.e., lung lavage). There is thus an urgent clinical need for effective drugs to retard the progression of silicosis. Methods: To systematically characterize the molecular changes associated with silicosis and to discover potential therapeutic targets, we conducted a transcriptomics analysis of human lung tissues acquired during transplantation, which was integrated with transcriptomics and metabolomics analyses of silicosis mouse lungs. The results from the multi-omics analyses were then verified by qPCR, western blot, and immunohistochemistry. The effect of Ramatroban on the progression of silicosis was evaluated in a silica-induced mouse model. Results: Wide metabolic alterations were found in lungs from both human patients and mice with silicosis. Targeted metabolite quantification and validation of expression of their synthases revealed that arachidonic acid (AA) pathway metabolites, prostaglandin D2 (PGD2) and thromboxane A2 (TXA2), were significantly up-regulated in silicosis lungs. We further examined the effect of Ramatroban, a clinical antagonist of both PGD2 and TXA2 receptors, on treating silicosis using a mouse model. The results showed that Ramatroban significantly alleviated silica-induced pulmonary inflammation, fibrosis, and cardiopulmonary dysfunction compared with the control group. Conclusion: Our results revealed the importance of AA metabolic reprogramming, especially PGD2 and TXA2 in the progression of silicosis.

We also quantified their ARID5B expression levels by real-time reverse transcription PCR, and determined their 50% inhibitory concentration (IC50) values by alamarBlue assays in nine representative chemotherapeutic agents used for ALL treatment. RESULTS: No significant associations were observed in genotypes of the susceptibility-linked single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and the relapsed-linked SNPs with ARID5B gene expression levels. Of note, IC50 values of vincristine (VCR) (median IC50: 39.6 ng/ml) in 12 cell lines with homozygous genotype of risk allele (C) in the relapse-linked rs4948488 were significantly higher (p = 0.031 in Mann-Whitney U test) than those (1.04 ng/ml) in 60 cell lines with heterozygous or homozygous genotypes of the non-risk allele (T). Furthermore, the IC50 values of mafosfamide [Maf; active metabolite of cyclophosphamide (CY)] and cytarabine (AraC) tended to be associated with the genotype of rs4948488. Similar associations were observed in genotypes of the relapse-linked rs2893881 and rs6479778, but not in those of the susceptibility-linked rs7923074 and rs10821936.

CONCLUSION: These observations in 72 BCP-ALL cell lines suggested that the risk allele of the relapse-linked SNPs of ARID5B may be involved in a higher relapse rate because of resistance to chemotherapeutic agents such as VCR, CY, and AraC.

Cattle are considered less sensitive to ZEN than pigs. However, ZEN has previously been shown to be converted to the highly estrogenic metabolite alpha-zearalenol (alpha-ZEL) in rumen fluid in vitro. Here, we investigate the metabolism of ZEN in the reticulorumen of dairy cows. To this end, rumen-fistulated non-lactating Holstein Friesian cows (n = 4) received a one-time oral dose of ZEN (5 mg ZEN in 500 g concentrate feed) and the concentrations of ZEN and ZEN metabolites were measured in free rumen liquid from three reticulorumen locations (reticulum, ventral sac and dorsal mat layer) during a 34-h period. In all three locations, alpha-ZEL was the predominant ZEN metabolite and beta-zearalenol (beta-ZEL) was detected in lower concentrations. ZEN, alpha-ZEL and beta-ZEL were eliminated from the ventral sac and reticulum within 34 h, yet low concentrations of ZEN and alpha-ZEL were still detected in the dorsal mat 34 h after ZEN administration. In a second step, we investigated the efficacy of the enzyme zearalenone hydrolase ZenA (EC 3.1.1.-, commercial name ZENzyme((R)), BIOMIN Holding GmbH, Getzersdorf, Austria) to degrade ZEN to the non-estrogenic metabolite hydrolyzed zearalenone (HZEN) in the reticulorumen in vitro and in vivo. ZenA showed a high ZEN-degrading activity in rumen fluid in vitro. When ZenA was added to ZEN-contaminated concentrate fed to rumen-fistulated cows (n = 4), concentrations of ZEN, alpha-ZEL and beta-ZEL were significantly reduced in all three reticulorumen compartments compared to administration of ZEN-contaminated concentrate without ZenA. Upon ZenA administration, degradation products HZEN and decarboxylated HZEN were detected in the reticulorumen. In conclusion, endogenous metabolization of ZEN in the reticulorumen increases its estrogenic potency due to the formation of alpha-ZEL. Our results suggest that application of zearalenone hydrolase ZenA as a feed additive may be a promising strategy to counteract estrogenic effects of ZEN in cattle.',\n",

Reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD(+))/nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide hydride (NADH) ratios were consistent with redirection of TCA cycle flux and relative electron acceptor deficiency.

The results showed that the inflorescence (Ns-F), and flowering herb of both plants gathered from natural habitat (Ns-H) and in-vitro-derived plants from the experimental plot (ExV-H) are the materials richest in polyphenols (195.4, 113.47, 112.1 mg GAE g(-1) d.w., respectively), and demonstrate the highest antioxidant activity (20.14, 11.24, and 11.46 mg AAE g(-1) d.w.). The extract from callus exhibited the lowest polyphenol content and antioxidant potential. The contents of total phenolics, flavonoids and phenolic acids correlate with the results of the antioxidant capacity of L. flos-cuculi extracts.',\n",

       "        'Metabolomics, synthetic biology, and microbiome research demand information about organism-scale metabolic networks. The convergence of genome sequencing and computational inference of metabolic networks has enabled great progress toward satisfying that demand by generating metabolic reconstructions from the genomes of thousands of sequenced organisms. Visualization of whole metabolic networks is critical for aiding researchers in understanding, analyzing, and exploiting those reconstructions. We have developed bioinformatics software tools that automatically generate a full metabolic-network diagram for an organism, and that enable searching and analyses of the network. The software generates metabolic-network diagrams for unicellular organisms, for multi-cellular organisms, and for pan-genomes and organism communities. Search tools enable users to find genes, metabolites, enzymes, reactions, and pathways within a diagram. The diagrams are zoomable to enable researchers to study local neighborhoods in detail and to see the big picture. The diagrams also serve as tools for comparison of metabolic networks and for interpreting high-throughput datasets, including transcriptomics, metabolomics, and reaction fluxes computed by metabolic models. These data can be overlaid on the metabolic charts to produce animated zoomable displays of metabolic flux and metabolite abundance. The BioCyc.org website contains whole-network diagrams for more than 18,000 sequenced organisms. The ready availability of organism-specific metabolic network diagrams and associated tools for almost any sequenced organism are useful for researchers working to better understand the metabolism of their organism and to interpret high-throughput datasets in a metabolic context.',\n",

Metabolite phenotyping helps to better understand complex metabolic diseases, such as melanoma, and facilitates the development of novel therapies. Our aim was to characterize the tumor and plasma metabolomes of mice bearing genetically different melanoma xenografts. We engrafted the human melanoma cell lines A375 (BRAF mutant), WM47 (BRAF mutant), WM3000 (NRAS mutant), and WM3311 (BRAF, NRAS, NF1 triple-wildtype) and performed a broad-spectrum targeted metabolomics analysis of tumor and plasma samples obtained from melanoma-bearing mice as well as plasma samples from healthy control mice. Differences in ceramide and phosphatidylcholine species were observed between melanoma subtypes irrespective of the genetic driver mutation. Furthermore, beta-alanine metabolism differed between melanoma subtypes and was significantly enriched in plasma from melanoma-bearing mice compared to healthy mice. Moreover, we identified beta-alanine, p-cresol sulfate, sarcosine, tiglylcarnitine, two dihexosylceramides, and one phosphatidylcholine as potential melanoma biomarkers in plasma. The present data reflect the metabolic heterogeneity of melanomas but also suggest a diagnostic biomarker signature for melanoma screening.',\n",

       "        'Fluoxetine is still one of the most widely used antidepressants in the world. The drug is extensively metabolized by several cytochrome P450 (CYP450) enzymes and subjected to a myriad of CYP450-mediated drug interactions. In a multidrug regimen, preemptive mitigation of drug-drug interactions requires knowledge of fluoxetine actions on these CYP450 enzymes. The major metabolic pathway of fluoxetine leading to the formation of its active metabolite, norfluoxetine, is mediated by CYP2D6. Fluoxetine and norfluoxetine are strong affinity substrates of CYP2D6 and can inhibit, potentially through various mechanisms, the metabolism of other sensitive CYP2D6 substrates. Remarkably, fluoxetine-mediated CYP2D6 inhibition subsides long after fluoxetine first passes through the liver and even remains long after the discontinuation of the drug. Herein, we review pharmacokinetic and pharmacogenetic information to help us understand the mechanisms underlying the prolonged inhibition of CYP2D6 following fluoxetine administration. We propose that long-term inhibition of CYP2D6 is likely a result of competitive inhibition. This is due to strong affinity binding of fluoxetine and norfluoxetine to the enzyme and unbound fluoxetine and norfluoxetine levels circulating in the blood for a long period of time because of their long elimination half-life. Additionally, we describe that fluoxetine is a CYP2C9 substrate and a mechanism-based inhibitor of CYP2C19.',\n",

       "        'Oxidative damage by reactive oxygen species (ROS) is one of the main contributors to cell injury and tissue damage in thalassemia patients. Recent studies suggest that ROS generation in non-transfusion-dependent (NTDT) patients occurs as a result of iron overload. Among the different sources of ROS, the nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH) oxidase family of enzymes and cytochrome P450 (CYP450) have been proposed to be major contributors for oxidative stress in several diseases. However, the sources of ROS in patients with NTDT remain poorly understood. In this study, Hbb(th3/+) mice, a mouse model for beta-thalassemia, were used. These mice exhibit an unchanged or decreased expression of the major NOX isoforms, NOX1, NOX2 and NOX4, when compared to their C57BL/6 control littermates. However, a significant increase in the protein synthesis of CYP4A and CYP4F was observed in the Hbb(th3/+) mice when compared to the C57BL/6 control mice. These changes were paralleled by an increased production of 20-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid (20-HETE), a CYP4A and CYP4F metabolite. Furthermore, these changes corroborate with onset of ROS production concomitant with liver injury. To our knowledge, this is the first report indicating that CYP450 4A and 4F-induced 20-HETE production mediates reactive oxygen species overgeneration in Hbb(th3/+) mice through an NADPH-dependent pathway.',\n",

In New Zealand, E. festucae var. lolii confers significant resistance to perennial ryegrass (Lolium perenne) against insect and animal herbivory and is an essential component of pastoral agriculture, where ryegrass is a major forage species. The fungus produces in planta a range of bioactive secondary metabolites, including ergovaline, which has demonstrated bioactivity against the important pasture pest black beetle, but can also cause mammalian toxicosis. We genetically modified E. festucae var. lolii strain AR5 to eliminate key enzymatic steps in the ergovaline pathway to determine if intermediate ergot alkaloid compounds can still provide insecticidal benefits in the absence of the toxic end product ergovaline. Four genes (dmaW, easG, cloA, and lpsB) spanning the pathway were deleted and each deletion mutant was inoculated into five different plant genotypes of perennial ryegrass, which were later harvested for a full chemical analysis of the ergot alkaloid compounds produced. These associations were also used in a black beetle feeding deterrence study. Deterrence was seen with just chanoclavine present, but was cumulative as more intermediate compounds in the pathway were made available. Ergovaline was not detected in any of the deletion associations, indicating that bioactivity towards black beetle can be obtained in the absence of this mammalian toxin.',\n",

In this study, urine samples from 50 PC patients and 50 non-cancerous individuals (control group) were collected. Based on (1)H nuclear magnetic resonance ((1)H-NMR) analysis, 20 metabolites were identified. Subsequently, principal component analysis (PCA), partial least squares-differential analysis (PLS-DA) and ortho-PLS-DA (OPLS-DA) were applied to find metabolites to distinguish PC from the control group. Furthermore, Wilcoxon test was used to find significant differences between the two groups in metabolite urine levels. Guanidinoacetate, phenylacetylglycine, and glycine were significantly increased in PC, while L-lactate and L-alanine were significantly decreased. The receiver operating characteristics (ROC) analysis revealed that the combination of guanidinoacetate, phenylacetylglycine, and glycine was able to accurately differentiate 77% of the PC patients with sensitivity = 80% and a specificity = 64%. In addition, those three metabolites showed significant differences in patients stratified for Gleason score 6 and Gleason score >/=7, indicating potential use to detect significant prostate cancer. Pathway enrichment analysis using the KEGG (Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes) and the SMPDB (The Small Molecule Pathway Database) revealed potential involvement of KEGG \"Glycine, Serine, and Threonine metabolism\" in PC. The present study highlights that guanidinoacetate, phenylacetylglycine, and glycine are potential candidate biomarkers of PC. To the best knowledge of the authors, this is the first study identifying guanidinoacetate, and phenylacetylglycine as potential novel biomarkers in PC.',\n",

Here, we aim to define the systemic metabolic consequences of NEN and to establish the diagnostic utility of proton nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy ((1)H-NMR) for NEN in a prospective cohort of patients through a single-centre, prospective controlled observational study. Urine samples of 34 treatment-naive NEN patients (median age: 59.3 years, range: 36-85): 18 had pancreatic (Pan) NEN, of which seven were functioning; 16 had small bowel (SB) NEN; 20 age- and sex-matched healthy control individuals were analysed using a 600 MHz Bruker (1)H-NMR spectrometer. Orthogonal partial-least-squares-discriminant analysis models were able to discriminate both PanNEN and SBNEN patients from healthy control (Healthy vs. PanNEN: AUC = 0.90, Healthy vs. SBNEN: AUC = 0.90). Secondary metabolites of tryptophan, such as trigonelline and a niacin-related metabolite were also identified to be universally decreased in NEN patients, while upstream metabolites, such as kynurenine, were elevated in SBNEN. Hippurate, a gut-derived metabolite, was reduced in all patients, whereas other gut microbial co-metabolites, trimethylamine-N-oxide, 4-hydroxyphenylacetate and phenylacetylglutamine, were elevated in those with SBNEN. These findings suggest the existence of a new systems-based neuroendocrine circuit, regulated in part by cancer metabolism, neuroendocrine signalling molecules and gut microbial co-metabolism. Metabonomic profiling of NEN has diagnostic potential and could be used for discovering biomarkers for these tumours. These preliminary data require confirmation in a larger cohort.',\n",

Increasing knowledge on chelating properties might be relevant for understanding the various beneficial effects of harzianic acid in the interaction between the producer fungi and plants. In this work, the coordination capacity of harzianic acid was studied to evaluate the formation and stability of complexes formed with toxic heavy metals (i.e., Cd(2+), Co(2+), Ni(2+), and Pb(2+)), which might have a crucial role in the tolerance of plants growing in metal-contaminated soils and in abiotic stress.',\n",

Elevated brain KYNA levels are commonly seen in psychiatric disorders and neurodegenerative diseases and may be related to cognitive impairments. Recently, we showed that N-acetylcysteine (NAC) inhibits kynurenine aminotransferase II (KAT II), KYNA's key biosynthetic enzyme, and reduces KYNA neosynthesis in rats in vivo. In this study, we examined if repeated systemic administration of NAC influences brain KYNA and cognitive performance in mice. Animals received NAC (100 mg/kg, i.p.) daily for 7 days. Redox markers, KYNA levels, and KAT II activity were determined in the brain. We also assessed the effect of repeated NAC treatment on Trp catabolism using brain tissue slices ex vivo. Finally, learning and memory was evaluated with and without an acute challenge with KYNA's bioprecursor L-kynurenine (Kyn; 100 mg/kg). Subchronic NAC administration protected against an acute pro-oxidant challenge, decreased KYNA levels, and lowered KAT II activity and improved memory both under basal conditions and after acute Kyn treatment. In tissue slices from these mice, KYNA neosynthesis from Trp or Kyn was reduced. Together, our data indicate that prolonged treatment with NAC may enhance memory at least in part by reducing brain KYNA levels.\",\n",

Although breeding and genetically modified and edited organisms have generated many varieties with greater abiotic stress tolerance, their practical use depends on lengthy processes, such as biological cycles and legal aspects. On the other hand, a non-genetic approach to improve crop yield in stress conditions involves the exogenous application of natural compounds, including plant metabolites. In this review, we examine the recent literature related to the application of different natural primary (proline, l-tryptophan, glutathione, and citric acid) and secondary (polyols, ascorbic acid, lipoic acid, glycine betaine, alpha-tocopherol, and melatonin) plant metabolites in improving tolerance to abiotic stress. We focus on drought, saline, heavy metal, and temperature as environmental parameters that are forecast to become more extreme or frequent as the climate continues to alter. The benefits of such applications are often evaluated by measuring their effects on metabolic, biochemical, and morphological parameters in a variety of crop plants, which usually result in improved yields when applied in greenhouse conditions or in the field. As this strategy has proven to be an effective way to raise plant tolerance to abiotic stress, we also discuss the prospect of its widespread implementation in the short term.',\n",

It is also easily accessible through NMR, which can provide a comprehensive understanding of the metabolome of any living organisms. However, the analysis of (1)H NMR spectrum remains difficult, mainly due to the different problems encountered to perform automatic identification and quantification of metabolites in a reproducible way. In addition, methods that perform automatic identification and quantification of metabolites are often designed to process one given complex mixture spectrum at a time. Hence, when a set of complex mixture spectra coming from the same experiment has to be processed, the approach is simply repeated independently for every spectrum, despite their resemblance. Here, we present new methods that are the first to either align spectra or to identify and quantify metabolites by integrating information coming from several complex spectra of the same experiment. The performances of these new methods are then evaluated on both simulated and real datasets. The results show an improvement in the metabolite identification and in the accuracy of metabolite quantifications, especially when the concentration is low.

In this mechanism-termed bioactivation-metabolic enzymes convert drugs into reactive metabolites that often conjugate to nucleophilic sites within biological macromolecules like proteins. Toxic metabolite-product adducts induce severe immune responses that can cause sometimes fatal disorders, most commonly in the form of liver injury, blood dyscrasia, or the dermatologic conditions toxic epidermal necrolysis and Stevens-Johnson syndrome. This study models four of the most common metabolic transformations that result in bioactivation: quinone formation, epoxidation, thiophene sulfur-oxidation, and nitroaromatic reduction, by synthesizing models of metabolism and reactivity. First, the metabolism models predict the formation probabilities of all possible metabolites among the pathways studied. Second, the exact structures of these metabolites are enumerated. Third, using these structures, the reactivity model predicts the reactivity of each metabolite. Finally, a feedfoward neural network converts the metabolism and reactivity predictions to a bioactivation prediction for each possible metabolite. These bioactivation predictions represent the joint probability that a metabolite forms and that this metabolite subsequently conjugates to protein or glutathione. Among molecules bioactivated by these pathways, we predicted the correct pathway with an AUC accuracy of 89.98%. Furthermore, the model predicts whether molecules will be bioactivated, distinguishing bioactivated and nonbioactivated molecules with 81.06% AUC. We applied this algorithm to withdrawn drugs. The known bioactivation pathways of alclofenac and benzbromarone were identified by the algorithm, and high probability bioactivation pathways not yet confirmed were identified for safrazine, zimelidine, and astemizole. This bioactivation model-the first of its kind that jointly considers both metabolism and reactivity-enables drug candidates to be quickly evaluated for a toxicity risk that often evades detection during preclinical trials.
