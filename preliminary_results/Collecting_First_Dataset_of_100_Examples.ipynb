The present study focuses on production, structural characterization and evaluation of photoprotective nature of melanin pigment derived from lime dwelling Pseudomonas sp. Melanin was characterized by solubility, UV-Vis, FT-IR, (13)C-CPMAS, ESI-MS spectroscopy, including particle size, melting point and elemental analyses. In vitro cytotoxicity and photo-protective effect of Pseudomonas derived melanin (Mel-P) against UV-B (Broad Band-BB) radiations were assessed on mouse fibroblasts NIH 3 T3 cell lines. Reactive Oxygen Species (ROS) generated in NIH 3 T3 cells upon UV-B (BB) exposure was determined and quantified by Fluorescent microscopic and Flow cytometric analyses. A natural melanin obtained from Pseudomonas sp. contains 5,6- dihydroxy indole 2-carboxyic acid (DHICA) as its basic constituent and possess typical properties of eumelanin as revealed by the characterization studies. Mel-P has shown cell viability of 61.33 +/- 6.58% at the concentration of 500 mug/mL proving its non-cytotoxic effect. Owing to its anti-oxidant property, melanin efficiently protected the mouse fibroblast cells from UV-B (BB) irradiation in a dose dependant manner demonstrating its potential as an active photoprotective agent.',\n",
       " '33516109': 'While ammonia (NH3) is one of the primary hazardous emissions from sludge aerobic composting plants, it has the potential to be recycled as an energy source or nitrogen fertilizer. Recently, an NH3 molecularly imprinted polymer (NH3-MIP) was developed that efficiently separated NH3 from other compounds, but its adsorption capacity required improvement. This study improved both NH3 adsorption capacity and separation of the NH3-MIP using acid hydrolysis optimization. NH3 adsorption capacity increased 13-fold and remained between 5.59 and 7.84 mmol.g(-1) during simulated sludge aerobic composting. Separation factors for NH3/methyl sulfide (DMS) (i.e. NH3 adsorption capacity/DMS adsorption capacity) and NH3/dimethyl disulfide both increased more than 15-fold. Results showed that hydrolysis of the ester crosslinker, ethylene glycol dimethacrylate, on the NH3-MIPs produced chemical adsorption sites (COOH and epoxides) and increased hydrogen bonds (COOH and alcohol hydroxyl), which promoted NH3 adsorption and separation. It is expected that this will be a beneficial strategy for elimination of odors and NH3 recovery during sludge aerobic composting.',\n",
       " '33516106': 'Material characterisation in nuclear environments is an essential part of decommissioning processes. This paper explores the feasibility of deploying commercial off the shelf (COTS) laser induced breakdown spectroscopy (LIBS) and Raman spectroscopy, for use in a decommissioning hot cell environment, to inform waste operation decision making. To operate these techniques, adapters and probes were designed and constructed, for each instrument, to form tools that a robotic arm could pick up and operate remotely from an isolated control room. The developed instrumentation successfully returned live measurement data to a control room for saving and further analysis (e.g. material classification/identification). Successful testing of the solutions was performed for contact LIBS, contact Raman and stand-off Raman on a PaR M3000 robotic arm, in a simulated hot cell environment and the limitations identified. Data obtained by the techniques are analysed, classified and presented in a 3D virtual environment. The spectral data collected by a basic COTS LIBS showed potential for use in contamination identification (beryllium is used as example). Potential for COTS, LIBS and Raman in decommissioning is established and improvements to the hardware, the measurement processes and how the data is stored and used, are identified.',\n",

In this work, a novel approach of integrated system with bioelectricity generation from septic tank wastewater by native microflora in the anode chamber, while Psathyrella candolleana with higher ligninolytic enzyme activity was employed at cathode chamber for the biodegradation of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs). Six MFC systems designated as MFC1, MFC2, MFC3, MFC4, MFC5, and MFC6 were experimented with different conditions. MFC1 system using natural microflora of STWW (100%) at anode chamber and K3[Fe(CN)6] as cathode buffer showed a power density and current density of 110 +/- 10 mW/m(2) and 90 +/- 10 mA/m(2) respectively. In the other five MFC systems 100% STWW was used at the anode and basidiomycetes fungi in the presence or absence of individual PAHs (naphthalene, acenaphthene, fluorene, and anthracene) at the cathode. MFC2, MFC3, MFC4, MFC5, and MFC6 had showed power density of 132 +/- 17 mW/m(2), 138 +/- 20 mW/m(2), 139 +/- 25 mW/m(2), and 147 +/- 10 mW/m(2) respectively. MFC2, MFC3, MFC4, MFC5, and MFC6 had showed current density of 497 +/- 17 mA/m(2), 519 +/- 10 mA/m(2), 522 +/- 21 mA/m(2) and 525 +/- 20 mA/m(2) respectively. In all the MFC systems, the electrochemical activity of anode biofilm was evaluated by cyclic voltammetry analysis and biofilms on all the MFC systems electrode surface were visualized by confocal laser scanning microscope. Biodegradation of PAHs during MFC experimentations in the cathode chamber was estimated by UV-Vis spectrophotometer. Overall, MFC6 system achieved maximum power density production of 525 +/- 20 mA/m(2) with 77% of chemical oxygen demand removal and 54% of coulombic efficiency at the anode chamber and higher anthracene biodegradation (62 +/- 1.13%) at the cathode chamber by the selected Psathyrella candolleana at 14th day. The present natural microflora - basidiomycetes fungal coupled MFC system offers excellent opening towards the simultaneous generation of green electricity and PAHs bioelectroremediation.',\n",
       " '33516096': \"Conversion of natural forest to anthropogenic land use systems (LUS) often leads to considerable loss of carbon, however, proper management of these LUS may reverse the trend. A study was conducted in a semi-deciduous forest zone of Cote d'Ivoire to assess soil microbial functioning and soil organic carbon (SOC) stocks in varying tree stands, and to determine whether complex tree stands can mimic the natural forest in terms of these soil attributes. Tree plantations studied were monocultures of teak (Tectona grandis) and full-sun cocoa (Theobroma cacao L.), and a mixture of four tree species (MTS) with Tectona grandis, Gmelina arborea, Terminalia ivoriensis and Terminalia superba. An adjacent natural forest was considered as the reference. Each of these LUS had five replicate stands where soil (0-10 cm depth) samples were taken for physico-chemical parameters and microbial biomass-C (MBC), microbial activities, MBC/SOC ratio and metabolic quotient (qCO2). SOC and total N stocks were also calculated. The C mineralization rate (mg C-CO2 kg(-1)) and mineral N concentration (mg kg(-1)) drastically declined in the monocultures of cocoa (154.9 +/- 29.3 and 49.8 +/- 9.8, respectively) and teak (179.6 +/- 27.1 and 54.1 +/- 7.3) compared to the natural forest (258.4 +/- 21.9 and 108.7 +/- 12). However, values in MTS (194.7 +/- 24.6 and 105.4 +/- 7.4) were not significantly different from those in the natural forest. Similarly, SOC stocks in MTS (28.8 +/- 1.9 Mg ha(-1)) were not significantly different from those recorded in the natural forest (32.9 +/- 1.7 Mg ha(-1)) whereas teak (25.4 +/- 1.7 Mg ha(-1)) and cocoa (23.1 +/- 3.4 Mg ha(-1)) exhibited significantly lower values. Despite the acidic soil and recalcitrant litter conditions, increased MBC/SOC ratio and decreased qCO2 were recorded in the monocrops, suggesting a probable increase in the fungi/bacteria ratio. The complex MTS stand was found to mimic the natural forest in terms of soil microbial activity and organic status, due to the provision of a diversity of litter quality, which may serve as a basis for developing a climate smart timber system in West and Central Africa.\",\n",
       " '33516049': 'Modifications to the flow profile used in open tube capillary liquid chromatography (OT-CLC) include using slip-flow walls and using electroosmosis as a fluid pump as practiced in electrochromatography. These modifications are implemented experimentally by changing the capillary surface and solvent conditions which results in the change of boundary conditions at the capillary wall. In this paper we employ a theory-based study and compare the zone broadening of simple solutes using parabolic flow from a liquid pump, slip-flow from a highly hydrophobic inner surface with water eluent, and electroosmosis for the conditions of pure water and dilute salt utilizing 2 microm inner diameter OT capillaries. In general, the two types of flow other than parabolic exhibit thin zones in the early part of the chromatogram, consistent with previous studies of slip-flow and electroosmotic flow used in electrochromatography. Electrochromatography is shown to yield higher efficiency and less zone broadening than parabolic and slip-flow conditions used in this study. Nonetheless, it is found that the zone standard deviations are shown to be similar for these flow profiles as is the number of plates for these different flow profiles under the conditions utilized here. It is revealed that these modifications do not warrant the effort to maintain the special solvent conditions when compared to gradient elution OT-CLC, which gives a nearly constant peak width throughout the chromatogram, is easiest to implement, and is the method of choice for complex analysis.',\n",
       " '33516030': 'In cull ewes, energy supply by time short periods can affect growth, carcass traits, and meat quality. The objective of this study was to evaluate the effect of biscuit bran (BB) and cashew nut bran (CNB) in diets with different total digestible nutrient (TDN) content on animal performance and carcass and meat traits of cull ewes. Twenty Morada Nova cull ewes, with the initial BW of 30.1+/-3.56kg, and three years of age were distributed in a completely randomized design into factorial scheme 2x2, with two energy sources (BB and CNB) x two levels of TDN. All diets were isoproteic with variations in TDN content increased by 10% (TDN10) and 25% (TDN25) above the recommended requirement for the study category, which was 66.0% TDN. The experimental period lasted 56days, in which daily intake in relation to metabolic weight and weight performance of the animals was determined. The hot carcass, the cold carcass, commercial cuts, loin eye area, and subcutaneous fat thickness were measured, obtained, or calculated. A sample of the Longissimus lumborum (LL) muscle was used by determination of physical-chemical composition, sensory, and fatty acid (FA) profile analysis. The ANOVA was performed to access the effect of diet and energy level on the characteristics studied, and means were compared by the Turkey and Kruskal Wallis tests at 5% of probability. A higher daily gain weight was observed from TDN25 (P=0.006). Among by-products, higher nutrient intakes were observed in animals fed with BB diets (P<0.01), except for crude protein. The same patterns have been observed for live weight, reconstituted half-carcass, higher yield in fat thickness, and internal carcass length. Cashew nut bran produced darker colored meat (P=0.017) and higher cooking weight loss (P=0.008). Higher lipid content was observed in animals submitted to diets with CNB and TDN25 (P=0.001). The internal length of the carcass was higher in animals fed with BB (P=0.041). All diets did not effect on sensory characteristics (P>0.05). Total digestible nutrient in 25% above recommended promotes higher weight gain and meat with higher lipid content and less weight loss by cooling. The inclusion of BB, compared to CNB, provides a higher weight of carcasses and better conformation, in addition to lower total lipid content with higher proportion for monounsaturated FAs in meat, providing more attractive features for the consumer market.',\n",
       " '33516016': \"Condensed tannins (CTs) are phenolic compounds derived from secondary plant metabolism that act as part of the plant's chemical defense system against pathogen invasion and herbivorous attack. This study aimed to evaluate the intake, digestibility, nitrogen (N) balance, production and composition of milk from goats fed cassava silage with added levels of CTs. Eight Anglo-Nubian goats with a mean BW of 40+/-2.0kg were distributed in a double Latin square design with four levels of CTs (0, 25, 50 and 75g/kg DM) with four 20-day periods with 15days of adaptation and five evaluation days for each period. No differences were observed in DM, NDF, CP intake and feed conversion (grams of DM intake (DMI) per gram of milk produced); however, when expressed as percent of BW, DMI showed a quadratic increase to 29.1g/kg. As the level of supplemented CTs increased in the diet, the CP digestibility (P=0.023), NDF (P=0.044), non-fiber carbohydrates (NFC; P=0.032) and total digestible nutrients (P=0.033) exhibited a linear decrease. Furthermore, the addition of CTs to cassava silage induced a linear increase in N-fecal excretion (P=0.014) and a positive quadratic effect on N-retained (P=0.014) and N-balance (P=0.024) as well as a positive quadratic trend in N-digested (P=0.092). Milk urea N (P=0.023) decreased linearly. The addition of CTs to cassava silage had a positive quadratic effect on ruminating time (P=0.011). In addition, comparing the use or non-use from the orthogonal contrast test, the inclusion of CTs in goat diet increased water and N-intake, CP and NDF digestibility, spent time eating and ruminating and N-balance and decreased milk production corrected(3.5%), fat milk content, milk urea N and dry defatted extract of milk. Thus, adding CTs to cassava silage at 25g/kg total DM promoted goats' greater use of the diet without impairing feed conversion and the quality of goat milk produced. Dietary levels of 50 and 75g/kg total DM are not recommended because under the conditions of this study, they reduced the productive efficiency of dairy goats.\",\n",
       " '33515968': 'A modified quick, easy, cheap, effective, rugged, and safe (QuEChERs) method for determining triazine herbicide residues in bivalves (Mussels, Scallops, Cockles) was developed. The use of molecularly imprinted polymers (MIPs) as a selective purification material during dispersive-solid phase extraction (d-SPE) increased the removal rate of pigments interference. With 4% acidic acetonitrile as the organic modifier, the modified QuEChERs method achieved good extraction rate of herbicide residues. The satisfactory recoveries (80%-118%) and RSDs (1.0%-11.6%) of herbicide residues were obtained at three spiked levels. The limits of quantification of herbicide residues ranged from 0.10 mug/kg to 1.59 mug/kg. Further, the herbicide residues in bivalves collected in the eastern coasts of China was analyzed. The developed QuEChERs procedure coupled with GC-MS/MS was successfully applied to the herbicide residues detection in bivalves, and due to the extensive use of herbicides and the large consumption of bivalves in globally, the ongoing risk evaluation is needed.',\n",
       " '33515963': 'A novel Z-scheme heterojunction C@WS2/g-C3N4 composite was prepared with carbon as a bridge for improving the photocatalytic property. The results of composition and structure studies demonstrate that the introduced carbon was deposited on the surface of WS2 with a film form in the ternary composites. The analysis of optical and photo-electrochemical properties reveals that the carbon film played as an electron-mediator in the ternary composites and could improve the separation and transportation of photogenerated charge. Meanwhile, it could change the pathway of photogenerated electrons between WS2 and g-C3N4, thereby constructing a Z-scheme heterojunction for maintaining the redox ability of photogenerated charge. The ternary 2%-C@WS2/g-C3N4 composite exhibited an excellent photodegradation rate towards 2,4-dichlorophenol (2,4-DCP) under visible light irradiation, which was 3.15 and 3.06 times of the pure g-C3N4 and binary WS2/g-C3N4 composite, respectively. Besides, the degradation pathway of 2,4-DCP and photocatalytic degradation mechanisms were investigated and discussed in detail. The generated .O2(-)(-), .OH and h(+) by ternary composites could promote the dechlorination reaction of 2,4-DCP effectively and decompose it into smaller organic molecules. This work extends the design of g-C3N4-based 2D/2D heterojunction or Z-scheme photocatalysts to remediate the environment.',\n",
       " '33515962': 'Despite showing serious health consequences and widespread exposure, the toxicokinetic information required to evaluate the health risks of BPS is insufficient. Thus, we aim to describe the comprehensive toxicokinetics of BPS and its glucuronide (BPS-G) and sulfate (BPS-S) metabolites in rats. Simultaneous quantification of BPS and its metabolites (authentic standards) was accomplished using UPLC-MS/MS method. BPS displayed rapid absorption, extensive metabolism and fast elimination after oral administration. Following intravenous administration, BPS exhibited CL (8.8 L/h/kg) higher than the rat hepatic blood flow rate suggesting the likelihood of extrahepatic clearance. The CL value differed from those reported previously (sheep and piglets) and the probable reason could be attributed to dose- and/or interspecies differences. BPS was extensively metabolized and excreted primarily through urine as BPS-G ( approximately 56%). BPS and BPS-S exhibited a high protein binding capacity in comparison to BPS-G. In in vitro metabolic stability study, BPS was predominantly metabolized through glucuronidation. The predicted in vivo hepatic clearance of BPS suggested it to be a high and intermediate clearance chemical in rats and humans, respectively. The significant interspecies difference observed in the clearance of BPS between rats and humans indicated that toxicokinetics of BPS should be considered for health risk assessment in humans.',\n",
       " '33515960': 'Electrostatic and complexation effects have been considered as the primary adsorption mechanisms for defluorination using aluminum based materials, while the effect of ion exchange between anions and fluorine ion has been mostly ignored, although synthesized alumina materials usually contain a large amount of anions, such as SO4(2-), NO3(-), and Cl(-). In this study, the effect of anions exchanges and its key role on defluorination were systematically investigated for adsorption by aluminas loaded with various typical anions (SO4(2-), NO3(-) and Cl(-)). Experimental results showed that SO4(2-)- loading alumina had the best defluorination performance (94.5 mg/g), much higher than NO3(-) (45.0 mg/g) and Cl(-) (19.1 mg/g). The contribution ratio of ion exchange between SO4(2-) and F(-) was as high as 20-60% in all potential defluorination mechanisms. By using Density Functional Theory calculation, the detailed mechanism revealed that the ion exchange process was mainly driven by the tridentate chelation of SO4(2-) which reduced the exchange energy ( [Formula: see text] 4.8 eV). Our study clearly demonstrated that ion exchange between SO4(2-) and F(-) is a critical mechanism in defluorination using aluminum-based materials and provides a potential alternative method to enhance the adsorption performance of modified alumina.',\n",

Superior models were obtained with variable selection methods based on low-level fusion data when compared with the corresponding methods based on single data blocks. Mid-level fusion data achieved the best model based on CARS, in comparison with all others.

The sensing strategy of QMC towards Pb(2+) ion exhibits a large blue shift with fluorescent enhancement via the intramolecular charge transfer (ICT) process. At the same time, QMC coordination with Pb(2+), the CN single bond rotation between quinoline and morpholine rings and the CN isomerization process were blocked. Best of our knowledge, this is the first blue shifted turn-on fluorescent chemosensor for Pb(2+) ion via the ICT process. Furthermore, QMC selectively detects Pb(2+) ion without any interference with alkali, alkaline earth, and transition metal ions, and limit of detection (LOD) downs to 13 muM, which is a permissible level of Pb(2+) ion in drinking water reported by WHO. The 1:2 binding stoichiometry between QMC and Pb(2+) was confirmed by fluorimetric, (1)H NMR titration, mass spectrometry, and theoretical studies. Finally, QMC was potentially applied for the sensing of Pb(2+) ions in milk, red wine, live cells and an INHIBIT molecular logic function was constructed by using Pb(2+) and EDTA as chemical inputs.',\n",

Here, adult female X. eiseni were exposed to 17alpha-ethinyloestradiol (EE2), a potent contraceptive oestrogen, at environmentally relevant concentrations, to investigate for effects on sex partitioning and development. Pregnant and non-pregnant females were exposed for four weeks to EE2 at measured concentrations of 0.9 and 3.4 ng/L EE2 and offspring from gravid females were kept in clean water for a further four weeks. Only pregnant females were seen to respond to 3.4 ng/L EE2 with an increase in the transcription of hepatic vitellogenins (vtgA, vtgB and vtgC). Offspring of exposed mothers showed no obvious effects on somatic growth, gonadal development, sex partitioning or development. However, there was a higher rate of deformities and developmental abnormalities in offspring of EE2-exposed females. The work presented provides the foundation for the development of X. eiseni as a new freshwater model for studies on maternal transfer of chemical pollutants in live bearing animals.',\n",

However, its dissatisfactory performance for the chemical measured signal is still blocking the practicability. Thus, this paper summarized the ICA processing path from the establishment of rectangular coordinates in linear space to the determination of the corresponding relation between the coordinate system and real components. The primary cause of the deviation between the ICA results and the chemical measurements is that the measuring signal was subject to uncertainty. Besides, uncertainty made the deviation of source signal from the statistical independence assumption, or in other words, it appeared to be nonorthogonal. For this key, it proposed to map the measured value to the high-order derivative space, use the derivative to narrow the peak width, reduce the influence of uncertainty, and improve the separation performance of ICA to chemical measurement signal, such as the spectrum. Actual cases of this paper showed that when up to 6th order, the separating results had been perfect for IR spectra, and even for homologs isomers.',\n",

No significant changes in protein secondary structures (alpha-helix content ~22%) and thermal protein stability in terms of enzyme tetramer subunits (Tm ~ 64 degrees C) were detected upon ligand binding. Alterations in the tertiary catalase structure were found without adverse effects on enzyme activity (~2 x 10(6) IU/mL). The docking study results indicated that the ligand most likely binds to amino acid residues (Asn141, Arg 362, Tyr369 and Asn384) near the cavity between the enzyme homotetramer subunits not related to the active site.

To counter this impending disaster, biodegradable polymers, especially polyhydroxy-alkanoates (PHAs), have been envisaged as potential alternatives. Owing to their unique physicochemical characteristics, PHAs are gaining importance for versatile applications in the agricultural and medical sectors. Applications in the medical sector are more promising because of their commercial viability and sustainability. Despite such potential, their production and commercialization are significant challenges. The major limitations are their poor mechanical strength, production in small quantities, costly feed, and lack of facilities for industrial production. This article provides an overview of the contemporary progress in the field, to attract researchers and stakeholders to further exploit these renewable resources to produce biodegradable plastics on a commercial scale.',\n",

The cultivation of different varieties of winter wheat in Galicia (commercial and native) under rotation systems with potato, maize and oilseed rape was evaluated from an environmental point of view. The general approach of this study included the gathering of the inventory data of the different crops, the quantification of their environmental impacts and economic benefits, to identify the best land management system. Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) was used as environmental tool. The environmental profiles of each rotation system were reported in terms of nine impact categories. Crop rotations were analysed both per hectare and per euro of gross margin, so that the information can be relevant to land-management decisions. Preference ranks were established based on an environmental normalized score for both units. The results suggest that arable operations contribute decisively to the environmental profile of the rotations. The avoided mineral fertilization processes, the carbon storage in the soil when returning straw to the field, as well as the electricity production clearly influence the environmental impact of the rotations. Scenarios that include native wheat under organic management are always the environmentally preferred ones while the preferred alternate crop depends on the reference unit. Concerning the margin gross, scenarios including the native variety report the highest profits, being the potato the preferred alternate crop. Further assessment needs to be undertaken to identify differences in the results of different ways of conducting LCA, i.e. attributional vs consequential approaches.',\n",

Since MPs are not easily biodegradable, they can provide the attachment substrates for various organisms, which will affect their floating and transport, and may also lead to the invasion of harmful microorganisms. In this study, polypropylene, polyethylene, polylactic acid pellets, and glass particles were exposed for 6 weeks in different seasons at three stations in the Yellow Sea, China. The results showed that the total amounts of biofilms significantly varied among seasons and functional zones and that the temperature of seawater was the main influencing factor. A variety of biological communities (especially diatoms and bacteria) and extracellular polymeric substances were observed on the MP surfaces using scanning electron microscopy and confocal laser scanning microscopy. Sequencing analysis indicated that the structure and composition of microbial communities on MPs mainly varied with seasons and locations. In addition, most of the microorganisms were generally attached to the surface and were not any specific selection of plastic by different chemical compositions.

Land use and vegetation type can affect the litter chemistry and bioavailability of organic carbon (OC), and consequently influence the processing and stabilisation of OC into SOM. We used (13)C nuclear magnetic resonance ((13)C NMR) and hot-water extraction to assess the changes in chemical composition and labile OC fractions during the transformation processes from leaf to litter to SOM depending on land use and vegetation type. The hot-water-extractable OC (HWEOC) decreased from leaf (43-65 g kg(-1)) to litter (19-23 g kg(-1)) to SOM (8-16 g kg(-1)) similar in four land use types: grassland, sugarcane, forest and banana. These trends demonstrated the uniform converging pathways of OC transformation and increasing stability by SOM formation. The preferential decomposition and decrease of labile OC fractions ( summation operator% di-O-alkyl, O-alkyl and methoxyl) from leaf (54-69%) to SOM (41-43%) confirmed the increasing stability of the remaining compounds. Despite differences in the biochemical composition of the leaf tissues among the vegetation types, the proportions of labile OC fractions in SOM were similar across land uses. The OC content of soil was higher in forest (7.9%) and grassland (5.2%) compared to sugarcane (2.3%) and banana (3.0%). Consequently, the HWEOC per unit of soil weight was higher in forest and grassland (2.0 and 1.2 g kg(-1) soil, respectively) compared to sugarcane and banana (0.3 and 0.4 g kg soil(-1), respectively). The availability of labile SOM is dependent on the quantity of SOM not the chemical composition of SOM. In conclusion, labile OC fractions in SOM, as identified by (13)C NMR, were similar across land use regardless of vegetation type and consequently, SOM formation leads to convergence of chemical composition despite diversity of OC sources.',\n",

However, limited information is available on the effect of biological wastewater treatment processes on the formation of CX3R-type DBPs. This study investigated the effect of oxidation ditch (OD) and anaerobic-anoxic-oxic (AAO), two widely used biological wastewater treatment processes, on the formation of five classes of CX3R-type DBPs, including trihalomethanes (THMs), haloacetic acids (HAAs), haloacetaldehydes (HALs), haloacetonitriles (HANs) and halonitromethanes (HNMs), during chlorination. Experimental results showed that biological treatment effectively reduced the dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and UV254, while it increased the dissolved organic nitrogen (DON), and therefore the ratio of DON/DOC. In addition, increases in the contents of soluble microbial product- and humic acid-like matters, and the transformation of high molecular weight (MW) fractions in the dissolved organic matter into low MW fractions were observed after OD and AAO processes. Although biological treatment effectively decreased the formation of Cl-THMs, Cl-HAAs, Cl-HANs and Cl-HNMs, the formation of DBCM, DBAA, BDCAA, DBCAA, DCAL, TCAL and DBAN (where C = chloro, B = bromo, D = di, T = tri) all increased significantly, due to the increased formation reactivity. Moreover, biological treatment increased the ratio of bromide/DOC and bromine incorporation into THMs, HAAs and DHANs except for HALs and THANs. Different from previous studies, this study revealed that biological treatment increased the formation of some DBPs, especially brominated DBPs, despite the efficient removal of organic matters.

However, evidence for PM2.5 constituents is still scarce, especially among patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). OBJECTIVE: To investigate the associations of short-term exposure to different chemical constituents of PM2.5 with measures of cardiac and lung function in COPD patients. METHODS: We conducted a retrospective panel study among 100 COPD patients who received repeated measures of left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF), forced expiratory volume in 1 s (FEV1), forced vital capacity (FVC) and peak expiratory flow (PEF) in Shanghai, China from August 2014 to September 2019. Daily PM2.5 and PM2.5 constituents were obtained from fixed-site monitoring station. Linear mixed-effects models were used to estimate the associations of PM2.5. RESULTS: We found water-soluble ions of PM2.5, mainly NO3(-), SO4(2-), and NH4(+) were robustly associated with reduced LVEF, and the reductions in LVEF associated with an IQR increase of them ranged from 1.8% to 2.0% (lag 1 d). Metal constituents such as Cu and As were associated with FEV1, FVC and PEF. The corresponding reductions in lung function parameters for an IQR increase of them ranged from 1.4% to 2.3% (lag 0 or 1 d). These associations remained relatively robust after adjusting for total PM2.5 mass and gaseous pollutants.

The results showed that the addition of nFe2O3 lowered the degree of EPS overproduction and the amount of polysaccharides and proteins secreted in NP contaminated sediment. Particularly, the secretion of colloidal EPS (C-EPS) lowered significantly (P < 0.05), and the content of tyrosine-like, tryptophan-like, and soluble microbial by-product-like substances in C-EPS also decreased, leading to a lower aromaticity, humification, and hydrophobicity of C-EPS. Furthermore, with lower C-EPS content in water, NP was adsorbed to sediment more easily, and the weakened toxic effect of NP to bacteria as well as a higher proportion of organic matter degrading microbes stimulated NP degradation. These findings revealed the vital role of nFe2O3 in alleviating NP toxicity to microbes and reducing NP ecological risk in aquatic environments.',\n",

The decay pathways of HSA-SOH were studied. HSA-SOH reacted with a thiol leading to the formation of a mixed disulfide. The reaction occurred through a concerted or direct displacement mechanism (SN2) with the thiolate (RS(-)) as nucleophile towards HSA-SOH. The net charge of the thiolate affected the value of the rate constant. In the presence of hydrogen peroxide, HSA-SOH was further oxidized to sulfinic (HSA-SO2H) and sulfonic acid (HSA-SO3H). The rate constants of these reactions were estimated. Lastly, HSA-SOH spontaneously decayed in solution. Mass spectrometry experiments suggested that the decay product is a sulfenylamide (HSA-SN(R')R''). Chromatofocusing analysis showed that the overoxidation with hydrogen peroxide predominates at alkaline pH whereas the spontaneous decay predominates at acidic pH.

We used an experimental rat stroke model subjected to 90 min of middle cerebral artery occlusion plus 24 hours or 7 days of reperfusion with or without acute hyperglycemia. We detected the production of peroxynitrite, the expression of NADPH oxidase, iNOS, MMPs and NLRP3 inflammasome in the ischemic brains, and evaluated infarct volume, brain edema, HT, neurological deficit score and survival rates. Our results show that: (1) Hyperglycemia increased the expression of NADPH oxidase subunits p47phox and p67phox, and iNOS, and the production of peroxynitrite. (2) Hyperglycemia increased infarct volume, aggravated the BBB hyperpermeability, induced brain edema and HT, and worsened neurological outcomes. These brain damages and poor outcome were reversed by the treatments of FeTmPyP (a representative peroxynitrite decomposition catalyst, PDC), peroxynitrite scavenger uric acid, and iNOS inhibitor 1400W. Furthermore, the activations of MMPs and NLRP3 inflammasome including pro/active-caspase-1 and IL-1beta were inhibited both PDC and 1400W, indicating the roles of peroxynitrite in the inductions of MMPs and NLRP3 inflammasome in the ischemic brains under hyperglycemia. (3) NLRP3 inflammasome inhibitor MCC950, caspase-1 inhibitor VX-765 and IL-1beta inhibitor diacerein attenuated brain edema, minimized hemorrhagic transformation and improved neurological outcome, demonstrating the roles of NLRP3 inflammasome in the hyperglycemia-mediated HT and poor outcome in the ischemic stroke rats with acute hyperglycemia. In conclusion, peroxynitrite could mediate activations of MMPs and NLRP3 inflammasome, aggravate the BBB damage and HT, and induce poor outcome in ischemic stroke with hyperglycemia.

AIM OF THE STUDY: investigate the hypoglycaemic effect of an ethanol extract (EE) of T. phaeocarpa leaves and its ethyl acetate (FrEtOAc) and hydromethanolic (FrMEOH) fractions, in addition to their activity on the release of pro-inflammatory mediators and inhibition of lipase, alpha-amylase, and alpha-glucosidase enzymes. Additionally, it aimed to characterize the chemical composition of the extract and fractions, seeking to identify the compounds related to the biological activities. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The effect on the release of TNF-alpha, IL-1beta, and CCL-2 was evaluated in LPS-stimulated THP-1 cells (ATCC TIB-202). The inhibition of lipase, alpha-amylase, and alpha-glucosidase was tested in vitro, whereas the hypoglycemic effect was assayed in the oral starch tolerance test. The chemical composition was investigated by extensive UHPLC-DAD-ESI-MS/MS analyses. RESULTS: The extract and derived fractions reduced TNF-alpha (EE pIC50 = 4.58 +/- 0.01; FrEtOAc pIC50 = 4.69 +/- 0.01; FrMeOH pIC50 = 4.54 +/- 0.02) and IL-1beta (EE pIC50 = 4.86 +/- 0.02; FrEtOAc pIC50 = 4.86 +/- 0.02; FrMeOH pIC50 = 4.75 +/- 0.01) release by LPS-stimulated THP-1 cells in a concentration-dependent manner, whereas the inhibitory effect on CCL-2 release did not reach a clear linear relationship for the tested concentrations. The extract and fractions also inhibited in vitro the activity of lipase (EE pIC50 = 3.97 +/- 0.12; FrEtOAc pIC50 = 3.87 +/- 0.04; FrMeOH pIC50 = 3.67 +/- 0.14), alpha-amylase (EE pIC50 = 4.46 +/- 0.27; FrEtOAc pIC50 = 5.47 +/- 0.27; FrMeOH pIC50 = 4.26 +/- 0.22), and alpha-glucosidase (EE pIC50 = 5.46 +/- 0.05; FrEtOAc pIC50 = 5.79 +/- 0.11; FrMeOH pIC50 = 5.74 +/- 0.05). The pIC50 values of the test samples were lower than those obtained with orlistat (7.59 +/- 0.08) and acarbose (6.04 +/- 0.37 and 7.63 +/- 0.04) employed as the positive controls respectively in the lipase, alpha-amylase, and alpha-glucosidase assays. When assayed in the oral starch tolerance test, the extract and fractions also reduced animal glycaemia. UHPLC-DAD-ESI-MS/MS analyses of the extract and fractions led to the identification of 38 phenolic compounds, mainly phenolic acids, ellagitannins and flavonoids, among others, all of them first-time described for the species. CONCLUSION: Based on our findings, T. phaeocarpa has hypoglycaemic activity and polyphenols are the probable bioactive compounds, which support the ethnomedical use of the species.',\n",

Castor oil plant has high traditional and medicinal values for treating liver infections, stomach ache, flatulence, constipation, inflammation, warts, colic, enteritis, fever, headache, and as a counter irritant. Its diverse phytochemicals have a wide range of valuable medicinal activities including hepatoprotective, anti-nociceptive, antioxidant, antiulcer, anticancer, anti-inflammatory, central analgesic, antidiabetic, antimicrobial, antiviral, and wound healing activity. AIM OF THE WORK: To provide a complete characterization of the composition of Ricinus communis leaves using ultra-performance liquid chromatography coupled with hybrid triple time-of-flight mass spectrometry (UPLC-Triple TOF-MS/MS) and different chromatographic techniques and to evaluate its antiviral potential using three mechanisms against three common viruses. MATERIALS AND METHODS: R. communis leaves were extracted with 70% methanol and further partitioned with solvents of increasing polarities: petroleum ether, dichloromethane (CH2Cl2), ethyl acetate, and n-butanol. The CH2Cl2 and n-butanol fractions were subjected to repeated chromatographic separation to isolate the phytochemicals, and their structures were elucidated using nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy. UPLC-Triple TOF-MS/MS was performed to determine the different phytochemicals in the ethyl acetate fraction. The antiviral activity of the extracts was investigated using the maximum nontoxic concentration of each against the challenge dose of the virus (CDV) and 1/10 and 1/100 dilutions of the CDV for Coxsackie B virus type 4 (COXB4), herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV1), and hepatitis A virus (HAV) using Vero cell cultures that were treated according to three protocols to test for anti-replicative, protective, and anti-infective antiviral activity. Cell viability was evaluated using the MTT colorimetric assay and each experiment is repeated three times independently of each other. RESULTS: R. communis leaves possessed antiviral activity. Evaluation of the anti-replicative activity showed that all extracts possessed high anti-replicative activity against HAV especially methanol and methylene chloride fractions and moderate activity against COXB4; butanol >methylene chloride and ethyl acetate >methanol. All extracts showed protective activity against HAV, especially butanol extract, while methanol extracts showed higher non-significant antiviral protective activity against HSV1 vs Acyclovir. Almost no anti-infective effects were recorded for any extract against the studied viruses. CONCLUSION: The discriminatory effect against each virus by different mechanisms suggests the presence of different chemical compounds. The alkaloid and phenolic derivatives of the extracts of R. communis leaves may help develop a drug to prevent or treat common viral infections. Further investigations are recommended to define the bioactive antiviral properties of R. communis leaves.',\n",

Whether ALDH2*2 would induce cardiac remodeling and increase the attack of atrial fibrillation (AF) remains poorly understood. The present study evaluated the effect of ALDH2*2 mutation on AF susceptibility and unravelled the underlying mechanisms using a multi-omics approach including whole-genome gene expression and proteomics analysis. The in-vivo electrophysiological study showed an increase in the incidence and reduction in the threshold of AF for the mutant mice heterozygous for ALDH2*2 as compared to the wild type littermates. The microarray analysis revealed a reduction in the retinoic acid signals which was accompanied by a downstream reduction in the expression of voltage-gated Na(+) channels (SCN5A). The treatment of an antagonist for retinoic acid receptor resulted in a decrease in SCN5A transcript levels. The integrated analysis of the transcriptome and proteome data showed a dysregulation of fatty acid beta-oxidation, adenosine triphosphate synthesis via electron transport chain, and activated oxidative responses in the mitochondria. Oral administration of Coenzyme Q10, an essential co-factor known to meliorate mitochondrial oxidative stress and preserve bioenergetics, conferred a protection against AF attack in the mutant ALDH2*2 mice. The multi-omics approach showed the unique pathophysiology mechanisms of concurrent dysregulated SCN5A channel and mitochondrial bioenergetics in AF. This inspired the development of a personalized therapeutic agent, Coenzyme Q10, to protect against AF attack in humans characterized by ALDH2*2 genotype.',\n",

       " '33515600': \"Rac1 is a small member of Rho GTPase family. One of the most important downstream effectors of Rac1 is a serine/threonine kinase, p21-activated kinase 1 (PAK1). Mutational activation of PAK1 by Rac1 has oncogenic signaling effects. Here, while we focus on Rac1-PAK1 interaction by atomic force microscopy (AFM)-based single molecule force spectroscopy (SMFS) experiments, we explore the effect of active mutations on the intrinsic dynamics and binding interactions of Rac1 by Gaussian Network Model (GNM) analysis and Molecular Dynamics (MD) simulations. We observe that Rac1 oncogenic mutations are at the hinges of three global modes of motion suggesting the mechanical changes as potential markers of oncogenicity. Indeed, the dissociation of wild-type Rac1-PAK1 complex shows two distinct unbinding dynamic states that are reduced to one with constitutively active Q61L and oncogenic Y72C mutant Rac1 as revealed by SMFS experiments. Q61L and Y72C mutations change the mechanics of Rac1-PAK1 complex by increasing elasticity of the protein and slow down the transition to the unbound state. On the other hand, Rac1's intrinsic dynamics reveal more flexible GTP and PAK1-binding residues on Switch I and II with Q61L, Y72C, oncogenic P29S and Q61R and negative T17N mutations. The cooperativity in the fluctuations of GTP-binding sites around p-loop and Switch I decreases in all mutants, mostly in Q61L, while some PAK1-binding residues display enhanced coupling with GTP-binding sites in Q61L and Y72C and within each other in P29S. The predicted binding free energies of the modeled Rac1-PAK1 complexes show that the change in the dynamic behavior likely means a more favorable PAK1 interaction. Overall, these findings suggest that the active mutations affect intrinsic functional dynamic events and alter the mechanics underlying the binding of Rac1 to GTP and upstream/downstream partners including PAK1.\",\n",

The FTIR analysis revealed that the BmImBr was successfully conjugated with the chitosan in the beads structure. The prepared beads were used as an efficient sorbent for the fast removal of methylene blue, as cationic dye model, from aqueous solution, whereas just 25 min was required to reach 86% removal efficiency. The increasing of BmImBr amount improved the adsorption performance of prepared beads. Also, it was found that the dye can be higher adsorbed on the beads surface by increasing the sorbent dosage and pH of solution, while the optimum dosage and pH were obtained 3 mg/L and 11, respectively.

       " '33515538': 'The clinical laboratory is a significant component of patient care, as laboratory data inform 60-70% of critical decisions related to admission, discharge, and medication administration. However, missteps occurring in specimen collection, transport and storage (preanalytical phase); testing (analytical phase); and reporting (post-analytical phase) may produce errors that affect patient safety and unnecessarily burden hospital budgets. Preanalytical errors may result from the devices used for blood collection. These devices have complex interactions with blood and can alter the composition of the serum and plasma fractions in ways that are not always fully appreciated by health care professionals. In some cases, such alterations can adversely affect laboratory test results. For instance, components of blood collection tubes (BCTs), including stoppers, stopper lubricants, tube walls, surfactants, clot activators, tube additives, and separator gels, may cause inaccuracies in test results by changing the chemical composition of the blood sample. Examples in the literature include BCTs leaching constituents into blood, adsorbing elements, or interacting with protein and cellular components. Additives and chemicals associated with BCT manufacturing can also significantly alter analyte stability in blood specimens. Here, we describe the case of a 14-month-old female with infectious mediastinitis and mild anemia who underwent a CT scan with contrast medium before blood collection. She has an increased INR and receives periodic boluses of diluted papaverine. After blood collection and subsequent tube centrifugation, abnormal gel migration was observed in one serum separator tube (SST), with gel trapped at the bottom of the tube below the clot. A review of the preanalytical system software confirmed that the SSTs from this patient were placed on the preanalytical line and centrifuged at 1300g for 10min. We performed several tests to determine the cause of the displaced gel at the bottom of the SSTs after centrifugation. Although not recommended by the tube manufacturer, recentrifugation (1300g for 10min) of the problematic SSTs resulted in proper gel separation. Thus, we hypothesized that the gel in the SSTs was defective and required additional centrifugation to move the gel upward in the tube to be positioned between the serum and cellular constituents. Abnormal gel movement to the top of the serum or plasma layer in SSTs or plasma separator tubes during centrifugation has been reported. This phenomenon has been attributed to an increased specific gravity of the serum or plasma, which in turn may be caused by hyperproteinemia or the presence of contrast medium used in diagnostic imaging. However, to our knowledge, ours is the first reported case of centrifuged gel remaining at the bottom of the SST. The finding of the gel at the bottom of an SST after centrifugation is important to laboratorians. Many clinical laboratories use preanalytical lines to centrifuge and transport tubes directly to chemistry instruments for analysis. These tubes are typically not visually inspected before the specimen is tested, hence improper gel separation in bottom of the tube. Partial or complete obstruction of the sample probes with cellular constituents may produce erroneous test results and increase turnaround time and costs, ultimately impacting patient care. Thus, this case may serve to remind clinical laboratorians that BCT failures are a source of preanalytical errors, and investigation of the integrity of BCTs is an essential part of trouble-shooting erroneous test results.',\n",

The All Heifer, No Cow (AHNC) beef production system involves insemination of nulliparous heifers with female sex-selected semen (FSS) to produce primarily female calves that are early weaned at 3 mo of age. Dams are finished on a high concentrate diet and harvested before 30 mo of age. The objectives of this research were to: 1) build a dynamic model of an AHNC beef production system to quantify system biological and economic efficiency; 2) compare effects of utilizing FSS vs. conventional semen on biological and economic efficiency; 3) evaluate what-if scenarios to determine the effects on biological and economic efficiency of changing variables +/-5%, 10%, 15%, and 20% from initial observed values; and 4) evaluate the effects on biological and economic efficiency of changing variables +/-10% from initial observed values. A model was built over a 21-yr horizon using Stella Architect. Biological parameter values in the model were based on the 6 yr of data collected from the management of an AHNC demonstration herd. In the model animal, total digestible nutrients (TDN) intake, hot carcass weight (HCW), and age at harvest were randomized. Feed, animal, and carcass prices included in the model were based on 10 yr of historical U.S. price data. Key response variables were biological and economic efficiency (mean +/- SD). Biological efficiency was defined as the ratio of output (kilograms of HCW produced) to input (lifetime kilograms of feed TDN consumed), and economic efficiency was measured using a benefit-cost ratio (BCR) and unit variable cost (UVC). Over 40 simulation runs, the predicted mean biological efficiency was 0.0714 +/- 0.0008. Economic efficiency was 0.95 +/- 0.02 and US $445.41 +/- 0.06 for BCR and UVC, respectively. Biological and economic efficiency was improved in the conventional semen scenario; biological efficiency was 0.0738 +/- 0.0008, and BCR and UVC were 0.99 +/- 0.04 and US $407.24 +/- 0.006, respectively.

A significant fraction of these wastes contains chromium compounds with chromium present in the hexavalent (Cr(+6)) form, which is hazardous to human beings, animals, and ecosystems. Since these wastes are discarded largely without proper treatments, soil and groundwater get contaminated and they can cause several health issues to human beings. Conventional methods developed to convert hazardous Cr(6+) to Cr(3+)/Cr metal either generate secondary toxic wastes and unwanted by-products and/or are time-consuming processes. In this work, a plasma-assisted aluminothermic process is developed to convert the toxic waste into non-toxic products. The waste was mixed with aluminium powder and subjected to transferred arc plasma treatment in a controlled air atmosphere. Chemical analysis and Cr leachability studies of the waste material prior to plasma treatment have shown that it is highly toxic. Analysis of the products obtained from the plasma treatment showed that Cr and Fe present in the waste could be recovered as a metallic mixture as well as oxide slag, which were found to be non-toxic. Easy separation of the metallic fraction and the slag from the treated product is one of the merits of this process. Besides converting chromium-containing toxic waste to non-toxic materials, the process is rapid and recovers the metals from the waste completely.',\n",

For repositioning of previously FDA-approved drugs to develop new therapies for human diseases, screening of chemical compound libraries, biological active, is an efficient method. Our study illustrates an example of drug repositioning of Biapenem (BIPM), a carbapenem antibiotic, for the modulation of HMGB1-induced septic responses. METHODS: We tested our hypothesis that BIPM inhibits HMGB1-induced vascular hyperpermeability and thereby increases the survival of septic mouse model from suppression of HMGB1 release upon lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-stimulation. In LPS-activated human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) and a cecal ligation and puncture (CLP)-induced sepsis mouse model, antiseptic activity of BIPM was investigated from suppression of vascular permeability, pro-inflammatory proteins, and markers for tissue injury. RESULTS: BIPM significantly suppressed release of HMGB1 both in LPS-activated HUVECs (upto 60%) and the CLP-induced sepsis mouse model (upto 54%). BIPM inhibited hyperpermeability (upto 59%) and reduced HMGB1-mediated vascular disruptions (upto 62%), mortality (upto 50%), and also tissue injury including lung, liver, and kidney in mice. CONCLUSION: Reduction of HMGB1 release and septic mortality by BIPM (in vitro, from 5 to 15 muM for 6 h; in vivo, from 0.37 to 1.1 mg/kg, 24 h) indicate a possibility of successful repositioning of BIPM for the treatment of sepsis.',\n",

Our calculations revealed that the binding energy of nucleobases shows the order of guanine (G) > cytosine (C) > thymine (T) > adenine (A). Based on the energy decomposition analysis (EDA), the G, C, and T strongly interact with the C3NNT, but the A nucleobase adsorbed mainly via electrostatic attraction and dispersion forces. We exposed that the nucleobase size and its carbonyl group determine its adsorption behavior. The DNA nucleobase adsorption meaningfully increased the electrical conductivity of C3NNT. The C3NNT sensing response toward G, C, T, or A was predicted to be 131, 66, 60, or 10. Therefore, the C3NNT might be applied to selectively detect the G, C, T, and A.

While bee flower choice is well studied, we know relatively little about how they choose between multiple rewarding flowers in complex floral environments. Two factors that could influence bee visual search for multiple flowers are the saliency (colour contrast against the background) and the reward value of flowers. We here investigated how these two different factors contribute to bee visual search. We trained bees to independently recognize two rewarding flower types that, in different experiments, differed in either saliency, reward value or both. We then measured their choices and attention to these flowers in the presence of distractors in a test without reinforcement. We found that bees preferred more salient or higher rewarding flowers and ignored distractors. When the high-reward flowers were less salient than the low-reward flowers, bees were nonetheless equally likely to choose high-reward flowers, for the reward and saliency values we used. Bees were also more likely to attend to these high-reward flowers, spending higher inspection times around them and exhibiting faster search times when choosing them. When flowers differed in reward, we also found an effect of the training order with low-reward targets being more likely to be chosen if they had been encountered during the more immediate training session prior to the test. Our results parallel recent findings from humans demonstrating that reward value can attract attention even when targets are less salient and irrelevant to the current task.',\n",

METHODS: We performed a systematic review of PubMed and EMBASE databases to identify studies evaluating the role of iodopovidone for pleurodesis in MPE. We calculated the pooled success rate of iodopovidone pleurodesis from observational studies and the risk ratio (RR) of successful pleurodesis (compared to other agents) from randomized controlled trials (RCTs). We pooled the data using the random-effects model. We also assessed the safety of iodopovidone. RESULTS: We included 26 studies (n = 1132, 15 observational, and 11 RCTs) in our review. The pooled success rate (95% confidence interval [CI]) from 15 observational studies (n = 648) was 90% (86-94). The efficacy rate of iodopovidone was similar with either tube thoracostomy or thoracoscopy. Eleven (n = 484) RCTs compared the efficacy of iodopovidone with other agents (especially bleomycin and talc). We found a similar success rate of iodopovidone compared to other agents with a pooled RR (95% CI) of 0.99 (0.91-1.08). The most frequent adverse event was chest pain. No hypo or hyperthyroidism, or visual disturbance was encountered in any study. There were no deaths attributed to iodopovidone use.

The chemical specification analysis found the sum of acid-soluble/exchangeable fraction (F1) and reducible fraction (F2) for Pb and Zn metals decreased by 26 and 40%; however, the residual fraction (F4) increased 33 and 46%, which contributed to the good stabilization of heavy metals in biochar. Besides, biochar achieved high H2S removal efficiency of 78.4% compared with the commercial activated carbon (AC). Furthermore, the biochar prepared by microwave pyrolysis had excellent adsorption performance, which was attributed to its larger specific surface area of 476.87m(2)/g under nitrogen atmosphere at 650(o)C compared with traditional pyrolysis. The mechanism analysis showed that microwave pyrolysis resulted in the high alkaline condition and formation of a large number of microparticles containing large metal elements on the biochar surface, which mainly contributed to the stabilization of heavy metals. The metal oxides adsorbed on the surface of biochar can catalyze the oxidation of H2S absorption, which will change the pH atmosphere of biochar reducing the leaching behavior of heavy metals.

In the detection process, the ZIF-90 is turned on under mild conditions by the competitive reaction of ATP with Zn(2+) and imidazole-2-carboxaldehyde (2-ICA), and the electrical signal of the system is amplified by the enzyme cascade reaction of GOx and HRP. Finally, based on the signal amplification strategy of the competitive reaction between Zn(2+) and ATP to construct a \"signal on\" mode, electrochemical immunosensor of GOx-HRP enzyme-linked cascade reaction was prepared. The proposed electrochemical immunosensor shows an excellent analytical performance when detecting CA-125, with good selectivity and stability, with a detection range of 0.1 pg mL(-1)-40 ng mL(-1) and a detection limit of 0.05 pg mL(-1). The test has been performed using chronoamperometry under a constant voltage of -0.4 V. The immunosensor also shows an excellent performance when analysing human blood samples. The recovery of the immunosensor is 97.94-101.8%, with a relative standard deviation of 3.7-6.1%.

We determine the impacts of invasive nitrogen-fixing Australian Acacia trees on soil chemistry and function (carbon, nitrogen, and phosphorus cycling) in South Africa's Core Cape Subregion, and whether any differences in soil function are linked to differences in soil chemical properties and bacterial community composition between neighbouring acacia-invaded and uninvaded sites. We do so by using Illumina MiSeq sequencing data together with soil chemistry and soil enzyme activity profiles. Acacias significantly increased levels of soil nitrogen (NO3(-), NH4(+), and total N), C, and pH. Although we did not find evidence that acacias affected soil bacterial community diversity, we did find them to alter bacterial community composition. Acacias also significantly elevated microbial phosphatase activity, but not beta-glucosidase, whilst having contrasting effects on urease. Changes in soil chemical properties under acacia invasion were found to correlate with changes in enzyme activities for urease and phosphatase. Similarly, changes in soil bacterial community composition were correlated to changes in phosphatase enzymatic activity levels under acacia invasion. Whilst we found evidence for acacias altering soil function by changing soil chemical properties and bacterial community composition, these impacts appear to be specific to local site conditions.\",\n",

GSEA needs both phenotype labels and expression of genes. However, gene expression are assessed more often for model organisms than minor species. Also, importantly gene expression are not measured well under specific conditions for human, due to high risk of direct experiments, such as non-approved treatment or gene knockout, and then often substituted by mouse. Thus, predicting enrichment significance (on a phenotype) of a given gene set of a species (target, say human), by using gene expression measured under the same phenotype of the other species (source, say mouse) is a vital and challenging problem, which we call CROSS-species gene set enrichment problem (XGSEP). RESULTS: For XGSEP, we propose the CROSS-species gene set enrichment analysis (XGSEA), with three steps of: (1) running GSEA for a source species to obtain enrichment scores and $p$-values of source gene sets; (2) representing the relation between source and target gene sets by domain adaptation; and (3) using regression to predict $p$-values of target gene sets, based on the representation in (2). We extensively validated the XGSEA by using five regression and one classification measurements on four real data sets under various settings, proving that the XGSEA significantly outperformed three baseline methods in most cases.

However, simulations point out that at the crossover of thermal and athermal regimes, the glass and jamming transitions may both be observed in the same sample. Here we conduct an experiment by shearing four oil-in-water emulsions with a rheometer.

To design and demonstrate such emergent properties like autonomous motion in nanomotors as an output of an Operando Systems Chemistry Algorithm (OSCAL), we employ a 2-component system comprising porous organic frameworks (POFs) and soft-oxometalates (SOMs). The OSCAL governs the motion of the nanocarpets by the coding and reading of information in an assembly/disassembly cascade switched on by a chemical stimulus. Assembly algorithm docks SOMs into the pores of the POFs of the nanocarpet leading to the encoding of supramolecular structural information in the SOM-POF hybrid nanocarpet. Input of a chemical fuel to the system induces a catalytic reaction producing propellant gases and switches on the disassembly of SOMs that are concomitantly released from the pores of the SOM-POF nanocarpets producing a ballast in the system as a read-out of the coded information acquired in the supramolecular assembly. The OSCAL governs the motion of the nanocarpets in steps. The assembly/disassembly of SOM-POFs, releasing SOMs from the pores of SOM-POFs induced by a catalytic reaction triggered by a chemical stimulus coupled with the evolution of gas are the input.

The individual electrode crystal orientations were investigated via X-ray diffraction (XRD) and electron backscattering diffraction (EBSD) techniques. As confirmed by the EBSD technique, the formation of high-index facets increases with an increase in the annealing temperature and reaches a high quantity of high-index facets enclosed mainly by (211) and (431) facets with about 94% of those on the electrode annealed at 1000 degrees C. As a possible application, we have used the different electrodes for CO2RR at -1.0 V vs. RHE with special emphasis on the formation of H2 gas and C1 products. Thus, the electrodes prepared at higher temperatures enable the suppression of competing H2 evolution due to the increased amount of high-index facets. Moreover, the formation rates of C1 products were inhibited as well at the electrodes with increased number of high-index facets.

Here, we suggest a new design strategy to improve the chemical stability of blue phosphorescent materials in the excited state. Introducing inter- and intra-ligand interactions in Ir and Pt complexes can dramatically increase the DeltaE(3MC-T1) because attractive or repulsive couplings arising from intra- or inter-ligand interactions can effectively prevent the out-of-plane bending vibrational mode in Ir complexes and the ring deformation vibrational mode in Pt complexes.

Genetic or pharmacological activation of mitochondrial stress signaling induces CFS gene expression and concomitant relocalization to CFSs of FANCD2. FANCD2 attenuates CFS gene transcription and promotes CFS gene stability.

Understanding the role of OH/F substitution in topaz is important in order to determine the hydrophilicity and the exchange reactions of fluorine by hydroxyl groups, and ultimately to characterize the environmental redox conditions (H2O/F) required for mineral formation. The fluorine content estimated from neutron diffraction data is ~ 1.03 a.f.u (10.34 wt%), in agreement with the chemical data (on average 10.0 wt%). The XOH [OH/(OH + F)] (0.484) is close to the maximum XOH value (0.5), and represents the OH- richest topaz composition so far analysed in the Minas Gerais district. Topaz crystallinity and fluorine content sharply decrease at 1170 K, while mullite phase starts growing.

Based on the commercial biosimilar product's composition, two basic variants, one acidic and the main bevacizumab product, were chosen for further investigation. Intact mass analysis and tryptic peptide mapping established the basic variants' identity as those originating from an incomplete clipping of either one or both C-terminal lysine residues in the heavy chain of bevacizumab. Based on peptide mapping data, the acidic variant formation was attributed to deamidation of asparagine residue (N84), oxidation of M258, and preservation of C-terminal lysine residue, located on the heavy chain of bevacizumab. None of the observed charge heterogeneities in bevacizumab were due to differences in glycosylation among the variants. The basic (lysine) variants exhibited similar structural, functional, and stability profiles as the bevacizumab main product. But it was also noted that both the variants did not improve bevacizumab's therapeutic utility when pooled in different proportions with the main product. The acidic variant was found to have an equivalent secondary structure with subtle differences in the tertiary structure. The conformational difference also translated into a ~ 62% decrease in biological activity.

In large-scale guava, methyl-eugenol (ME)-bait stations combined with toxic protein baits suppressed B. dorsalis within 8 months but resulted in a resurgence of the displaced Ceratitis capitata. In smallholder farms, intervention using SPLAT-ME laced with spinosad was surprisingly unsuccessful. Subsequent mark-release-recapture experiments showed high dispersal rates of flies, covering many times a typical farm size, leading to a continuous influx of flies from surrounding areas. Several other factors important for intervention were evaluated. SPLAT-MAT-ME dollops remained attractive for over two weeks, although gradually becoming less attractive than fresh baits. Further, competitive displacement was observed: C. capitata selectively emerged from fruits in which B. dorsalis infestation was low. Finally, we evaluated whether ME could be combined with C. capitata male attractants [trimedlure (TML) and terpinyl acetate (TA)] without affecting attraction. Combining male lures did not affect catches directly, although at very high populations of B. dorsalis attracted to ME interfered with C. capitata trap entry. Although ME-based methods can effectively suppress B. dorsalis, they were not effective at single smallholder scale due to the high dispersive propensity of tephritids. Further, competitive release implies the need for a combination of lures and methods. These observations are important for developing control schemes tailored for African smallholder settings.',\n",

This scheme enables (i) automatic compensation for wavelength-dependent fluence variations in spectroscopic PA imaging and (ii) motion correction of spectroscopic PA frames using US speckle tracking in real-time systems. The 50-Hz video rate PAUS system is demonstrated in vivo using a murine model of labelled drug delivery.',\n",
       " '33514735': 'The Tafel slope is a key parameter often quoted to characterize the efficacy of an electrochemical catalyst. In this paper, we develop a Bayesian data analysis approach to estimate the Tafel slope from experimentally-measured current-voltage data. Our approach obviates the human intervention required by current literature practice for Tafel estimation, and provides robust, distributional uncertainty estimates. Using synthetic data, we illustrate how data insufficiency can unknowingly influence current fitting approaches, and how our approach allays these concerns. We apply our approach to conduct a comprehensive re-analysis of data from the CO2 reduction literature. This analysis reveals no systematic preference for Tafel slopes to cluster around certain \"cardinal values\" (e.g. 60 or 120 mV/decade). We hypothesize several plausible physical explanations for this observation, and discuss the implications of our finding for mechanistic analysis in electrochemical kinetic investigations.',\n",
       " '33514734': 'Azoles are five-membered heterocycles often found in the backbones of peptidic natural products and synthetic peptidomimetics. Here, we report a method of ribosomal synthesis of azole-containing peptides involving specific ribosomal incorporation of a bromovinylglycine derivative into the nascent peptide chain and its chemoselective conversion to a unique azole structure. The chemoselective conversion was achieved by posttranslational dehydrobromination of the bromovinyl group and isomerization in aqueous media under fairly mild conditions. This method enables us to install exotic azole groups, oxazole and thiazole, at designated positions in the peptide chain with both linear and macrocyclic scaffolds and thereby expand the repertoire of building blocks in the mRNA-templated synthesis of designer peptides.',\n",
       " '33514724': 'We report the development of a platform of dual targeting Fab (DutaFab) molecules, which comprise two spatially separated and independent binding sites within the human antibody CDR loops: the so-called H-side paratope encompassing HCDR1, HCDR3 and LCDR2, and the L-side paratope encompassing LCDR1, LCDR3 and HCDR2. Both paratopes can be independently selected and combined into the desired bispecific DutaFabs in a modular manner. X-ray crystal structures illustrate that DutaFabs are able to bind two target molecules simultaneously at the same Fv region comprising a VH-VL heterodimer. In the present study, this platform is applied to generate DutaFabs specific for VEGFA and PDGF-BB, which show high affinities, physico-chemical stability and solubility, as well as superior efficacy over anti-VEGF monotherapy in vivo. These molecules exemplify the usefulness of DutaFabs as a distinct class of antibody therapeutics, which is currently being evaluated in patients.',\n",
       " '33514723': 'Electron sources are a critical component in a wide range of applications such as electron-beam accelerator facilities, photomultipliers, and image intensifiers for night vision. We report efficient, regenerative and low-cost electron sources based on solution-processed halide perovskites thin films when they are excited with light with energy equal to or above their bandgap. We measure a quantum efficiency up to 2.2% and a lifetime of more than 25 h. Importantly, even after degradation, the electron emission can be completely regenerated to its maximum efficiency by deposition of a monolayer of Cs. The electron emission from halide perovskites can be tuned over the visible and ultraviolet spectrum, and operates at vacuum levels with pressures at least two-orders higher than in state-of-the-art semiconductor electron sources.',\n",
       " '33514710': 'Here we benchmark device-to-device variation in field-effect transistors (FETs) based on monolayer MoS2 and WS2 films grown using metal-organic chemical vapor deposition process. Our study involves 230 MoS2 FETs and 160 WS2 FETs with channel lengths ranging from 5 mum down to 100 nm. We use statistical measures to evaluate key FET performance indicators for benchmarking these two-dimensional (2D) transition metal dichalcogenide (TMD) monolayers against existing literature as well as ultra-thin body Si FETs. Our results show consistent performance of 2D FETs across 1 x 1 cm(2) chips owing to high quality and uniform growth of these TMDs followed by clean transfer onto device substrates. We are able to demonstrate record high carrier mobility of 33 cm(2) V(-1) s(-1) in WS2 FETs, which is a 1.5X improvement compared to the best reported in the literature. Our experimental demonstrations confirm the technological viability of 2D FETs in future integrated circuits.',\n",
       " '33514706': 'Metallic tungsten disulfide (WS2) monolayers have been demonstrated as promising electrocatalysts for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) induced by the high intrinsic conductivity, however, the key challenges to maximize the catalytic activity are achieving the metallic WS2 with high concentration and increasing the density of the active sites. In this work, single-atom-V catalysts (V SACs) substitutions in 1T-WS2 monolayers (91% phase purity) are fabricated to significantly enhance the HER performance via a one-step chemical vapor deposition strategy. Atomic-resolution scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) imaging together with Raman spectroscopy confirm the atomic dispersion of V species on the 1T-WS2 monolayers instead of energetically favorable 2H-WS2 monolayers. The growth mechanism of V SACs@1T-WS2 monolayers is experimentally and theoretically demonstrated. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations demonstrate that the activated V-atom sites play vital important role in enhancing the HER activity. In this work, it opens a novel path to directly synthesize atomically dispersed single-metal catalysts on metastable materials as efficient and robust electrocatalysts.',\n",
       " '33514702': 'Optical activity, also called circular birefringence, is known for two hundred years, but its applications for topological photonics remain unexplored. Unlike the Faraday effect, the optical activity provokes rotation of the linear polarization of light without magnetic effects, thus preserving the time-reversal symmetry. In this work, we report a direct measurement of the Berry curvature and quantum metric of the photonic modes of a planar cavity, containing a birefringent organic microcrystal (perylene) and exhibiting emergent optical activity. This experiment, performed at room temperature and at visible wavelength, establishes the potential of organic materials for implementing non-magnetic and low-cost topological photonic devices.',\n",
       " '33514700': 'Though the concept of Berry force was proposed thirty years ago, little is known about the practical consequences of this force as far as chemical dynamics are concerned. Here, we report that when molecular dynamics pass near a conical intersection, a massive Berry force can appear as a result of even a small amount of spin-orbit coupling (<10(-3) eV), and this Berry force can in turn dramatically change pathway selection. In particular, for a simple radical reaction with two outgoing reaction channels, an exact quantum scattering solution in two dimensions shows that the presence of a significant Berry force can sometimes lead to spin selectivity as large as 100%. Thus, this article opens the door for organic chemists to start designing spintronic devices that use nuclear motion and conical intersections (combined with standard spin-orbit coupling) in order to achieve spin selection. Vice versa, for physical chemists, this article also emphasizes that future semiclassical simulations of intersystem crossing (which have heretofore ignored Berry force) should be corrected to account for the spin polarization that inevitably arises when dynamics pass near conical intersections.',\n",
       " '33514697': \"Significant efforts have been devoted in the last twenty years to developing compounds that can interfere with the aggregation pathways of proteins related to misfolding disorders, including Alzheimer's and Parkinson's diseases. However, no disease-modifying drug has become available for clinical use to date for these conditions. One of the main reasons for this failure is the incomplete knowledge of the molecular mechanisms underlying the process by which small molecules interact with protein aggregates and interfere with their aggregation pathways. Here, we leverage the single molecule morphological and chemical sensitivity of infrared nanospectroscopy to provide the first direct measurement of the structure and interaction between single Abeta42 oligomeric and fibrillar species and an aggregation inhibitor, bexarotene, which is able to prevent Abeta42 aggregation in vitro and reverses its neurotoxicity in cell and animal models of Alzheimer's disease. Our results demonstrate that the carboxyl group of this compound interacts with Abeta42 aggregates through a single hydrogen bond. These results establish infrared nanospectroscopy as a powerful tool in structure-based drug discovery for protein misfolding diseases.\",\n",
       " '33514696': 'Piezoelectric polymers hold great potential for various electromechanical applications, but only show low performance, with |d33 | < 30 pC/N. We prepare a highly piezoelectric polymer (d33 = -62 pC/N) based on a biaxially oriented poly(vinylidene fluoride) (BOPVDF, crystallinity = 0.52). After unidirectional poling, macroscopically aligned samples with pure beta crystals are achieved, which show a high spontaneous polarization (Ps) of 140 mC/m(2). Given the theoretical limit of Ps,beta = 188 mC/m(2) for the neat beta crystal, the high Ps cannot be explained by the crystalline-amorphous two-phase model (i.e., Ps,beta = 270 mC/m(2)). Instead, we deduce that a significant amount (at least 0.25) of an oriented amorphous fraction (OAF) must be present between these two phases. Experimental data suggest that the mobile OAF resulted in the negative and high d33 for the poled BOPVDF. The plausibility of this conclusion is supported by molecular dynamics simulations.',\n",
       " '33514695': \"Creating a security label that carries entirely distinct information in reflective and fluorescent states would enhance anti-counterfeiting levels to deter counterfeits ranging from currencies to pharmaceuticals, but has proven extremely challenging. Efforts to tune the reflection color of luminescent materials by modifying inherent chemical structures remain outweighed by substantial trade-offs in fluorescence properties, and vice versa, which destroys the information integrity of labels in either reflection or fluorescent color. Here, a strategy is reported to design geminate labels by programming fluorescent cholesteric liquid crystal microdroplets (two-tone inks), where the luminescent material is 'coated' with the structural color from helical superstructures. These structurally defined microdroplets fabricated by a capillary microfluidic technique contribute to different but intact messages of both reflective and fluorescent patterns in the geminate labels. Such two-tone inks have enormous potential to provide a platform for encryption and protection of valuable authentic information in anti-counterfeiting technology.\",\n",
       " '33514660': 'An effective vaccine that can protect against HIV infection does not exist. A major reason why a vaccine is not available is the high mutability of the virus, which enables it to evolve mutations that can evade human immune responses. This challenge is exacerbated by the ability of the virus to evolve compensatory mutations that can partially restore the fitness cost of immune-evading mutations. Based on the fitness landscapes of HIV proteins that account for the effects of coupled mutations, we designed a single long peptide immunogen comprising parts of the HIV proteome wherein mutations are likely to be deleterious regardless of the sequence of the rest of the viral protein. This immunogen was then stably expressed in adenovirus vectors that are currently in clinical development. Macaques immunized with these vaccine constructs exhibited T-cell responses that were comparable in magnitude to animals immunized with adenovirus vectors with whole HIV protein inserts. Moreover, the T-cell responses in immunized macaques strongly targeted regions contained in our immunogen. These results suggest that further studies aimed toward using our vaccine construct for HIV prophylaxis and cure are warranted.',\n",
       " '33514659': 'Classic antibody functions include opsonization, complement activation, and enhancement of cellular antimicrobial function. Antibodies can also have catalytic activity, although the contribution of catalysis to their biological functions has been more difficult to establish. With the ubiquity of catalytic antibodies against glycans virtually unknown, we sought to advance this knowledge. The use of a glycan microarray allowed epitope mapping of several monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) against the capsule of Cryptococcus neoformans From this, we designed and synthesized two glycan-based FRET probes, which we used to discover antibodies with innate glycosidase activity and analyze their enzyme kinetics, including mAb 2H1, the most efficient identified to date. The validity of the FRET assay was confirmed by demonstrating that the mAbs mediate glycosidase activity on intact cryptococcal capsules, as observed by a reduction in capsule diameter. Furthermore, the mAb 18B7, a glycosidase hydrolase, resulted in the appearance of reducing ends in the capsule as labeled by a hydroxylamine-armed fluorescent (HAAF) probe. Finally, we demonstrate that exposing C. neoformans cells to catalytic antibodies results in changes in complement deposition and increased phagocytosis by macrophages, suggesting that the antiphagocytic properties of the capsule have been impaired. Our results raise questions over the ubiquity of antibodies with catalytic activity against glycans and establish the utility of glycan-based FRET and HAAF probes as tools for investigating this activity.',\n",
       " '33514654': 'Highly sensitive approaches to target insulin-expressing cells would allow more effective imaging, sorting, and analysis of pancreatic beta-cells. Here, we introduce the use of a reaction-based probe, diacetylated Zinpyr1 (DA-ZP1), to image pancreatic beta-cells and beta-like cells derived from human pluripotent stem cells. We harness the high intracellular zinc concentration of beta-cells to induce a fluorescence signal in cells after administration of DA-ZP1. Given its specificity and rapid uptake by cells, we used DA-ZP1 to purify live stem cell-derived beta-like cells as confirmed by immunostaining analysis. We tested the ability of DA-ZP1 to image transplanted human islet grafts and endogenous mouse pancreatic islets in vivo after its systemic administration into mice. Thus, DA-ZP1 enables purification of insulin-secreting beta-like cells for downstream applications, such as functional studies, gene-expression, and cell-cell interaction analyses and can be used to label engrafted human islets and endogenous mouse islets in vivo.'}"
