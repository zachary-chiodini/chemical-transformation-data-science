Blood and saliva samples were collected at selected time intervals after dosing. All urine and feces were collected on the 10 consecutive days after dose administration. Radioactivity in each sample was determined by liquid scintillation counting or complete oxidation and liquid scintillation counting. Metabolic profiles in plasma, urine, and feces were obtained by HPLC, and metabolites were identified by mass spectrometry and NMR. [(14)C]Celecoxib was well absorbed, reaching peak plasma concentrations within 2 h of dosing.

The total percentage of administered radioactive dose recovered was 84.8 +/- 4.9%, with 27.1 +/- 2.2% in the urine and 57.6 +/- 7.3% in the feces. The oxidative metabolism of celecoxib involved hydroxylation of celecoxib at the methyl moiety followed by further oxidation of the hydroxyl group to form a carboxylic acid metabolite. The carboxylic acid metabolite of celecoxib was conjugated with glucuronide to form the 1-O-glucuronide. The percentages of the dose excreted in the feces as celecoxib and the carboxylic acid metabolite were 2.56 +/- 1.09 and 54.4 +/- 6.8%, respectively.

In this study, we investigated the pharmacokinetic properties of curcumin in mice. After i.p. administration of curcumin (0.1 g/kg) to mice, about 2.25 microg/ml of curcumin appeared in the plasma in the first 15 min. One hour after administration, the levels of curcumin in the intestines, spleen, liver, and kidneys were 177.04, 26.06, 26.90, and 7.51 microg/g, respectively. Only traces (0.41 microg/g) were observed in the brain at 1 h. To clarify the nature of the metabolites of curcumin, the plasma was analyzed by reversed-phase HPLC, and two putative conjugates were observed. Treatment of the plasma with beta-glucuronidase resulted in a decrease in the concentrations of these two putative conjugates and the concomitant appearance of tetrahydrocurcumin (THC) and curcumin, respectively. To investigate the nature of these glucuronide conjugates in vivo, the plasma was analyzed by electrospray. The chemical structures of these metabolites, determined by mass spectrometry/mass spectrometry analysis, suggested that curcumin was first biotransformed to dihydrocurcumin and THC and that these compounds subsequently were converted to monoglucuronide conjugates. Because THC is one of the major metabolites of curcumin, we studied its stability at different pH values. THC was very stable in 0.1 M phosphate buffers of various pH values. Moreover, THC was more stable than curcumin in 0.1 M phosphate buffer, pH 7.2 (37 degrees C). These results, together with previous findings, suggest that curcumin-glucuronoside, dihydrocurcumin-glucuronoside, THC-glucuronoside, and THC are major metabolites of curcumin in vivo.',\n",

Animal studies have shown the carcinogenicity of acrylamide upon oral exposure. However, only sparse human toxicokinetic data is available for acrylamide, which is needed for the extrapolation of human cancer risk from animal data. We evaluated the toxicokinetics of acrylamide in six young healthy volunteers after the consumption of a meal containing 0.94 mg of acrylamide. Urine was collected up to 72 hours thereafter. Unchanged acrylamide, its mercapturic acid metabolite N-acetyl-S-(2-carbamoylethyl)cysteine (AAMA), its epoxy derivative glycidamide, and the respective metabolite of glycidamide, N-acetyl-S-(2-hydroxy-2-carbamoylethyl)cysteine (GAMA), were quantified in the urine by liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry. Toxicokinetic variables were obtained by noncompartmental methods. Overall, 60.3 +/- 11.2% of the dose was recovered in the urine. Although no glycidamide was found, unchanged acrylamide, AAMA, and GAMA accounted for urinary excretion of (mean +/- SD) 4.4 +/- 1.5%, 50.0 +/- 9.4%, and 5.9 +/- 1.2% of the dose, respectively. Apparent terminal elimination half-lives for the substances were 2.4 +/- 0.4, 17.4 +/- 3.9, and 25.1 +/- 6.4 hours. The ratio of GAMA/AAMA amounts excreted was 0.12 +/- 0.02. In conclusion, most of the acrylamide ingested with food is absorbed in humans. Conjugation with glutathione exceeds the formation of the reactive metabolite glycidamide. The data suggests an at least 2-fold and 4-fold lower relative internal exposure for glycidamide from dietary acrylamide in humans compared with rats or mice, respectively. This should be considered for quantitative cancer risk assessment.',\n",

       "       [\"The extent of bioactivation of the herbal constituent estragole to its ultimate carcinogenic metabolite 1'-sulfooxyestragole depends on the relative levels of bioactivation and detoxification pathways. The present study investigated the kinetics of the metabolic reactions of both estragole and its proximate carcinogenic metabolite 1'-hydroxyestragole in humans in incubations with relevant tissue fractions. Based on the kinetic data obtained a physiologically based biokinetic (PBBK) model for estragole in human was defined to predict the relative extent of bioactivation and detoxification at different dose levels of estragole. The outcomes of the model were subsequently compared with those previously predicted by a PBBK model for estragole in male rat to evaluate the occurrence of species differences in metabolic activation. The results obtained reveal that formation of 1'-oxoestragole, which represents a minor metabolic route for 1'-hydroxyestragole in rat, is the main detoxification pathway of 1'-hydroxyestragole in humans. Due to a high level of this 1'-hydroxyestragole oxidation pathway in human liver, the predicted species differences in formation of 1'-sulfooxyestragole remain relatively low, with the predicted formation of 1'-sulfooxyestragole being twofold higher in human compared with male rat, even though the formation of its precursor 1'-hydroxyestragole was predicted to be fourfold higher in human. Overall, it is concluded that in spite of significant differences in the relative extent of different metabolic pathways between human and male rat there is a minor influence of species differences on the ultimate overall bioactivation of estragole to 1'-sulfooxyestragole.\",\n",

Metabolites from 3NT were 3-nitrobenzoic acid (56%), 3-nitrobenzyl alcohol (29%), and 3-nitrobenzyl alcohol glucuronide (13%). 4NT was metabolized to S-(4-nitrobenzyl)glutathione (68%), 4-nitrobenzyl alcohol (12%), sulfate and glucuronide conjugates of 4-nitrobenzyl alcohol (6%), and 4-nitrobenzoic acid (2%) (expressed as percentage of total metabolism). The formation of the respective nitrobenzyl alcohols by hepatocytes was linear with respect to time for 15-20 min. The formation of other metabolites was linear over a 45-min incubation period. Incubation of 2NT, 3NT, or 4NT (1 mM) with rat hepatic microsomes produced only the respective nitrobenzyl alcohols and the rate of formation was linear for 90 min.

Noncytotoxic concentrations of BPA (10, 20, and 35 microM; 1.0 microCi), as assessed by lactate dehydrogenase leakage, were incubated with isolated hepatocytes for 0-6 h.

In hepatocytes of male Fischer-344 rats, the predominate metabolite was the diconjugate (glucuronide/sulfate). Under these conditions, the extent of metabolism by 3 h was similar in all species tested because all BPA was converted to conjugates by 3 h.

The reductive dechlorination also seems to proceed nonenzymatically with the reduced flavin, catalyzed by the heme group of cytochrome P450. Similar enzymatic and nonenzymatic reducing activities were observed toward o,p'-DDT [1,1,1-trichloro-2,2-bis(2-chlorophenyl-4-chlorophenyl)ethane].\",\n",

We incubated 1 with liver microsomes of rat, bovine, and human origin. We found 2, 3-hydroxymethylisoeugenol (3), and 6-hydroxymethyleugenol (4) as major metabolites, and 1-oxomethyleugenol (5), 3-oxomethylisoeugenol (6), eugenol (9), chavibetol (11), and (RS)-2,3-dihydroxy-2,3-dihydromethyleugenol (7) as minor metabolites. Methyleugenol-2,3-epoxide (8), probably the precursor of 7, could not be detected. Incubations with synthetic metabolites were applied in order to uncover metabolic pathways. Incubations with primary rat hepatocytes revealed mainly nonconjugated 2 and conjugated 4, and minor amounts of partly conjugated 7 and conjugated 9 + 11. The \"reactive metabolites\" 3, 5, 6, and 8 were not detectable, possibly due to rapid reaction with cellular macromolecules. The highest cytotoxicity (resazurin reduction assay and lactate dehydrogenase leakage assay) was observed for the main metabolite 2 and its secondary metabolite 5 with EC(50) values of 50 and 10 microM, respectively. Deoxyadenosine or deoxyguanosine adducts were formed by incubating 1 or metabolites with rat hepatocytes. The rank order of adduct formation was 2 > 1 > 3 > 6, whereas 4, 5, and 8 were inactive.

Approximately 84% of the administered radioactivity was recovered from the urine and feces of the subjects over a period of 312 h. Approximately 80% of the dose for EM subjects was recovered within 48 h. PM subjects, however, excreted only about 45% of the dose in 48 h and required the full 312 h to achieve nearly 80% recovery. Absorption of CP-122,721 was rapid in both extensive and poor metabolizers, as indicated by the rapid appearance of radioactivity in serum. The serum concentrations of total radioactivity were always much greater than those of unchanged drug indicating early formation of metabolites. The average CP-122,721 t1/2 was 6.7 h and 45.0 h for EM and PM subjects, respectively. The serum concentrations of CP-122,721 reached a peak of 7.4 and 69.8 ng/ml for extensive and poor metabolizers, respectively. The major metabolic pathways of CP-122,721 were due to O-demethylation, aromatic hydroxylation, and indirect glucuronidation. The minor metabolic pathways included aliphatic oxidation at the piperidine moiety, O-dealkylation of the trifluoromethoxy group, N-dealkylation, and oxidative deamination. In addition to the major human circulating metabolite 5-trifluoromethoxy salicylic acid (TFMSA), all other circulating metabolites of CP-122,721 were glucuronide conjugates of oxidized metabolites. TFMSA was identified using high pressure liquid chromatography/tandem mass spectrometry and NMR and mechanisms were proposed for its formation.

       "       ['INTRODUCTION: Isopropanol is a clear, colorless liquid with a fruity odor and a mild bitter taste. Most commonly found domestically as rubbing alcohol, isopropanol is also found in numerous household and commercial products including cleaners, disinfectants, antifreezes, cosmetics, solvents, inks, and pharmaceuticals. AIM: The aim of this review is to critically review the epidemiology, toxicokinetics, mechanisms of toxicity, clinical features, diagnosis, and management of isopropanol poisoning. METHODS: OVID MEDLINE and ISI Web of Science were searched to November 2013 using the words \"isopropanol\", \"isopropyl alcohol\", \"2-propanol\", \"propan-2-ol\", and \"rubbing alcohol\" combined with the keywords \"poisoning\", \"poison\", \"toxicity\", \"ingestion\", \"adverse effects\", \"overdose\", or \"intoxication\". These searches identified 232 citations, which were then screened via their abstract to identify relevant articles referring specifically to the epidemiology, toxicokinetics, mechanisms of toxicity, clinical features, diagnosis, and management of isopropanol poisoning; 102 were relevant. Further information was obtained from book chapters, relevant news reports, and internet resources. These additional searches produced eight non-duplicate relevant citations. EPIDEMIOLOGY: The majority of isopropanol exposures are unintentional and occur in children less than 6 years of age. Although isopropanol poisoning appears to be a reasonably common occurrence, deaths are rare. TOXICOKINETICS: Isopropanol is rapidly absorbed following ingestion with peak plasma concentrations occurring within 30 min. It can also be absorbed following inhalation or dermal exposure. Isopropanol is widely distributed with a volume of distribution of 0.45-0.55 L/kg. Isopropanol is metabolized by alcohol dehydrogenase to acetone, acetol and methylglyoxal, propylene glycol, acetate, and formate with conversion of these metabolites to glucose and other products of intermediary metabolism. The elimination of isopropanol is predominantly renal, though some pulmonary excretion of isopropanol and acetone occurs. In one case 20% of the absorbed dose was eliminated unchanged in urine, with the remainder excreted as acetone and metabolites of acetone. The elimination half-life of isopropanol is between 2.5 and 8.0 h, whereas elimination of acetone is slower with a half-life following isopropanol ingestion of between 7.7 and 27 h. MECHANISMS OF TOXICITY: While the exact mechanism of action of isopropanol has not been fully elucidated, brain stem depression is thought to be the predominant mechanism. While the clinical effects are thought to be mostly due to isopropanol, acetone may also contribute. CLINICAL FEATURES: The major features of severe poisoning are due to CNS and respiratory depression, shock, and circulatory collapse. The most common metabolic effects are an increased osmol (osmolal) gap, ketonemia, and ketonuria. Diagnosis. Poisoning can be diagnosed using the measurement of isopropanol serum concentrations, though these may not be readily available. Diagnosis is therefore more typically made on the basis of the patient\\'s history and clinical presentation. An osmol gap, ketonemia, and/or ketonuria without metabolic acidosis, along with a fruity or sweet odor on the breath and CNS depression support the diagnosis. Management. Supportive care is the mainstay of management with primary emphasis on respiratory and cardiovascular support. Hemodialysis enhances elimination of isopropanol and acetone and should be considered in very severe poisoning. CONCLUSIONS: Severe isopropanol poisoning results in CNS and respiratory depression and circulatory collapse. Treatment primarily consists of symptom-directed supportive care. Although hemodialysis increases the elimination of isopropanol and acetone substantially, it should only be considered in severe life-threatening poisonings. Patients usually make a full recovery provided they receive prompt supportive care.',\n",

In order to determine whether major differences exist in the routes of DNB metabolism, male Fischer-344 rats were given an oral dose (0.15 mmol/kg) of 14C-labeled 1,2-, 1,3-, or 1,4-DNB, and excreta were collected over 48 hr. Elimination of radiolabel was rapid; 85%, 60%, and 75% of the 1,2-, 1,3-, and 1,4-DNB dose was recovered in 24 hr, respectively. Urine was the primary route of excretion, accounting for 82% of the total dose of 1,2-DNB and 75% of the dose of 1,4-DNB after 48 hr. Radiolabel from 1,3-DNB was excreted to a slightly lesser extent in the urine (63% of the dose). A greater portion of radiolabel was excreted in the feces than with the other isomers (18% of total dose, compared to 8% and 9% with 1,2-DNB and 1,4-DNB, respectively). The major urinary metabolites of 1,2-DNB were S-(2-nitrophenyl)-N-acetylcysteine (42% of the dose), 2-nitroaniline-N-glucuronide (4%), 4-amino-3-nitrophenylsulfate (17%), 2-amino-3-nitrophenylsulfate (1.5%), and 2-(N-hydroxylamino)nitrobenzene (1-2%). The major urinary metabolites of 1,3-DNB were 3-aminoacetanilide (22%), 4-acetamidophenylsulfate (6%), 1,3-diacetamidobenzene (7%), and 3-nitroaniline-N-glucuronide (4%). The major metabolites of 1,4-DNB were 2-amino-5-nitrophenylsulfate (35%), S-(4-nitrophenyl)-N-acetylcysteine (13%), and 1,4-diacetamidobenzene (7%). These results suggest that the DNB isomers are primarily metabolized by nitro group reduction and conjugation with glutathione. The testicular toxicant 1,3-DNB was apparently metabolized exclusively by reduction.',\n",

Urine and faeces were collected and urinary metabolites were assayed by radio-TLC and HPLC. Other animals were killed at various times and exsanguinated, and plasma levels of 14C in Plasma occurred earliest and were highest when benzyl acetate was given neat. Peak levels were lower and absorption was delayed with the propylene glycol vehicle. The use of corn oil as the dose vehicle at the higher doses (250 and 500 mg/kg) led to the maintenance of plateau plasma levels, at about one half of the peak levels seen with the neat compound, for up to 8 hr after administration. At the 5 mg/kg dose, the plasma levels of 14C were essentially the same whether the dose was given in corn oil or propylene glycol. At the 250- and 500-mg/kg doses, at all time points, the major metabolite in plasma was benzoic acid, accompanied by smaller amounts of hippuric acid. Benzyl alcohol was also detected in some plasma samples. At the 5-mg/kg dose, the major plasma metabolite was hippuric acid, together with a smaller amount of benzoic acid. When propylene glycol was used as the vehicle at this dose level, benzylmercapturic acid was also present in the plasma. The major urinary metabolite was hippuric acid (c. 66% of the dose), with benzoic acid (2%) and benzylmercapturic acid (1%) also present. The elimination of benzoyl glucuronide increased with increasing dose, from c. 3 to 11% of the dose.',\n",

Metabolites recovered in urines were analysed by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) after 24, 48 and 72 hours. Six metabolites were identified. Mono-n-butyl phthalate (MBuP) and mono-n-benzyl phthalate (MBeP) represented respectively 29-34% and 7-12% of the total recovered metabolites. Hippuric acid, the main metabolite of benzoic acid, represented the second major metabolite (51-56%). Phthalic acid, benzoic acid and an omega-oxidized metabolite of MBuP were also recovered in urine but in small quantities. BBP was never identified in urines. Total urinary metabolites recovery represented 56% of the dose administered in the first 24 hours. However, total recovery decreased when the dose increases (43% at 780 mg/kg body weight/day, only 30% at 1500 mg/kg body weight/day). Whatever the time was, BBP metabolites recovered in urines were all present and in the same proportions for the two lowest doses. Discrepancy in metabolites quantities expressed as percentages of the dose observed in urine of rat treated with the highest BBP dose disappeared with time as MBuP, MBeP and hippuric acid recovery has significantly increased at day 3. Metabolic profile of BBP in female rats has been established.

Naphthalene causes dose-dependent cytotoxicity to murine airway epithelial cells but a link between exposure and human pulmonary disease has not been established. Naphthalene toxicity in rodents depends on P450 metabolism. Subsequent biotransformation results in urinary elimination of several conjugated metabolites. Glucuronide and sulfate conjugates of naphthols have been used as markers of naphthalene exposure but, as the current studies demonstrate, these assays provide a limited view of the range of metabolites generated from the parent hydrocarbon. Here, we present a liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry method for measurement of the glucuronide and sulfate conjugates of 1-naphthol as well as the mercapturic acids and N-acetyl glutathione conjugates from naphthalene epoxide. Standard curves were linear over 2 log orders. On column detection limits varied from 0.91 to 3.4 ng; limits of quantitation from 1.8 to 6.4 ng. The accuracy of measurement of spiked urine standards was -13.1 to + 5.2% of target and intra-day and inter-day variability averaged 7.2 (+/- 4.5) and 6.8 (+/- 5.0) %, respectively. Application of the method to urine collected from mice exposed to naphthalene at 15 ppm (4 hrs) showed that glutathione-derived metabolites accounted for 60-70% of the total measured metabolites and sulfate and glucuronide conjugates were eliminated in equal amounts. The method is robust and directly measures several major naphthalene metabolites including those derived from glutathione conjugation of naphthalene epoxide. The assays do not require enzymatic deconjugation, extraction or derivatization thus simplifying sample work up.',\n",

       "       ['Intraperitoneal injection of 5 mumol of acetone/g, body weight, into 3 rats previously fed 1% acetone (v/v) in their drinking water resulted in the appearance in blood serum of 16 +/- 2 nmol of 1,2-propanediol/ml and 8 +/- 1 nmol of 2,3-butanediol/ml. No detectable 1,2-propanediol or 2,3-butanediol was found in the serum of animals after acetone or saline injection without prior addition of acetone to drinking water or in the serum of animals injected with saline after having been maintained on drinking water containing 1% acetone. These data suggest that acetone both acts to induce a critical enzyme or enzymes and serves as a precursor for the production of 1,2-propanediol. It is also clear from these data that chronic acetone feeding plays a role in 2,3-butanediol production in the rat. Microsomes isolated from the liver of animals maintained on drinking water supplemented with 1% acetone contained two previously unreported enzymatic activities, acetone monooxygenase which converts acetone to acetol and acetol monooxygenase which converts acetol to methylglyoxal. Both activities require O2 and NADPH. Prior treatment with acetone increased serum D-lactate from 9 nmol/ml +/- 9 nmol/ml in control animals to 77 +/- 36 nmol/ml in acetone-fed animals after injection with 5 mumol of acetone/g, body weight. This is consistent with methylglyoxal being a by-product of acetone metabolism. Two pathways for the conversion of acetone to glucose are proposed, the methylglyoxal and the propanediol pathways. The methylglyoxal pathway is responsible for the conversion of acetone to acetol, acetol to methylglyoxal, and the subsequent conversion of methylglyoxal to glucose. The propanediol pathway involves the conversion of acetol to L-1,2-propanediol by an as yet unknown process. L-1,2-Propanediol is converted to L-lactaldehyde by alcohol dehydrogenase, and L-lactaldehyde is converted to L-lactic acid by aldehyde dehydrogenase. Expression of these metabolic pathways in rat appears to be dependent on the induction of acetone monooxygenase and acetol monooxygenase by acetone.',\n",

       "       ['Curcumin, the yellow pigment in turmeric, has been shown to prevent malignancies in a variety of tissues in rodents, especially in the intestinal tract. Pharmacological activities of curcumin in cells in situ germane to chemoprevention, such as inhibition of expression of cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2), require drug concentrations in the 10(-5) - 10(-4) M range. The systemic bioavailability of curcumin is low, so that its pharmacological activity may be mediated, in part, by curcumin metabolites. To investigate this possibility, we compared curcumin metabolism in human and rat hepatocytes in suspension with that in rats in vivo. Analysis by high-performance liquid chromatography with detection at 420 and 280 nm permitted characterization of metabolites with both intact diferoylmethane structure and increased saturation of the heptatrienone chain. Chromatographic inferences were corroborated by mass spectrometry. The major metabolites in suspensions of human or rat hepatocytes were identified as hexahydrocurcumin and hexahydrocurcuminol. In rats, in vivo, curcumin administered i.v. (40 mg/kg) disappeared from the plasma within 1 h of dosing. After p.o. administration (500 mg/kg), parent drug was present in plasma at levels near the detection limit. The major products of curcumin biotransformation identified in rat plasma were curcumin glucuronide and curcumin sulfate whereas hexahydrocurcumin, hexahydrocurcuminol, and hexahydrocurcumin glucuronide were present in small amounts. To test the hypothesis that curcumin metabolites resemble their progenitor in that they can inhibit COX-2 expression, curcumin and four of its metabolites at a concentration of 20 microM were compared in terms of their ability to inhibit phorbol ester-induced prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) production in human colonic epithelial cells. Curcumin reduced PGE2 levels to preinduction levels, whereas tetrahydrocurcumin, previously shown to be a murine metabolite of curcumin, hexahydrocurcumin, and curcumin sulfate, had only weak PGE2 inhibitory activity, and hexahydrocurcuminol was inactive. The results suggest that (a) the major products of curcumin biotransformation by hepatocytes occur only at low abundance in rat plasma after curcumin administration; and (b) metabolism of curcumin by reduction or conjugation generates species with reduced ability to inhibit COX-2 expression. Because the gastrointestinal tract seems to be exposed more prominently to unmetabolized curcumin than any other tissue, the results support the clinical evaluation of curcumin as a colorectal cancer chemopreventive agent.',\n",

       "       [\"Dapsone (DDS) has for about 4 decades been the most important antileprosy drug. Concentrations of dapsone and its monoacetyl metabolite, MADDS, can be determined in biological media by high-performance liquid chromatography. After oral administration, the drug is slowly absorbed, the maximum concentration in plasma being reached at about 4 hours, with an absorption half-life of about 1.1 hours. However, the extent of absorption has not been adequately determined. The elimination half-life of dapsone is about 30 hours. The drug shows linear pharmacokinetics within the therapeutic range and the time-course after oral administration fits a 2-compartment model. The concentration-time profile of dapsone after parenteral administration is reviewed. Of clinical importance is the development of a new long acting injection, which permits monthly supervised administration as recommended by the World Health Organization. Following dapsone injection in gluteal subcutaneous adipose tissue, a sufficiently sustained absorption for this purpose has been reported. Dapsone is about 70 to 90% protein bound and its monoacetylated metabolite (MADDS) is almost completely protein bound. The volume of distribution of dapsone is estimated to be 1.5 L/kg. It is distributed in most tissues, but M. leprae living in the Schwann cells of the nerves might be unaffected. Dapsone crosses the placenta and is excreted in breast milk and saliva. Dapsone is extensively metabolised. Dapsone, some MADDS and their hydroxylated metabolites are found in urine, partly conjugated as N-glucuronides and N-sulphates. The acetylation ratio (MADDS:dapsone) shows a genetically determined bimodal distribution and allows the definition of 'slow' and 'rapid' acetylators. As enterohepatic circulation occurs, the elimination half-life of dapsone is markedly decreased after oral administration of activated charcoal. This permits successful treatment in cases of intoxication. The daily dose of dapsone in leprosy is 50 to 100mg, but varies from 50 to 400mg in the treatment of other dermatological disorders. In malaria prophylaxis, a weekly dose of 100mg is used in combination with pyrimethamine. Side effects are mostly not serious below a daily dose of 100mg and are mainly haematological effects. The dapsone therapeutic serum concentration range can be defined as 0.5 to 5 mg/L. Alcoholic liver disease decreases the protein binding of dapsone; coeliac disease and dermatitis herpetiformis may delay its oral absorption and severe leprosy has been reported to affect the extent of absorption.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)\",\n",

In a previous study, a silicon analog of haloperidol (sila-haloperidol) was synthesized, which contains a silicon atom instead of the carbon atom in the 4-position of the piperidine ring. In the present study, the phase I metabolism of sila-haloperidol and haloperidol was studied in rat and human liver microsomes. The phase II metabolism was studied in rat, dog, and human hepatocytes and also in liver microsomes supplemented with UDP-glucuronic acid (UDPGA). A major metabolite of haloperidol, the pyridinium metabolite, was not formed in the microsomal incubations with sila-haloperidol. For sila-haloperidol, three metabolites originating from opening of the piperidine ring were observed, a mechanism that has not been observed for haloperidol. One of the significant phase II metabolites of haloperidol was the glucuronide of the hydroxy group bound to the piperidine ring. For sila-haloperidol, the analogous metabolite was not observed in the hepatocytes or in the liver microsomal incubations containing UDPGA. If silanol (SiOH) groups are not glucuronidated, introducing silanol groups in drug molecules could provide an opportunity to enhance the hydrophilicity without allowing for direct phase II metabolism. To provide further support for the observed differences in metabolic pathways between haloperidol and sila-haloperidol, the metabolism of another pair of C/Si analogs was studied, namely, trifluperidol and sila-trifluperidol.

In this work the mechanism of formation of cell membrane nanovesicles (CNVs) was studied experimentally and theoretically. CNVs were isolated by centrifugation and washing of blood cells and observed by optical microscopy and scanning electron microscopy. The shape of the biological membrane in the budding process, as observed in phospholipid vesicles, in erythrocytes and in CNVs, was described by an unifying model. Taking the mean curvature h and the curvature deviator d of the membrane surface as the relevant parameters, the shape and the distribution of membrane constituents were determined theoretically by minimization of membrane free energy. Considering these results and previous results on vesiculation of red blood cells it was interpreted that the budding processes may lead to formation of different types of CNVs as regards the compartment (exo/endovesicles), shape (spherical/tubular/torocytic) and composition (enriched/depleted in particular kinds of molecules). It was concluded that the specificity of pinched off nanovesicles derives from the shape of the membrane constituents and not primarily from their chemical identity, which explains evidences on great heterogeneity of isolated extracellular vesicles with respect to composition.',\n",

Hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) and gluconic acid were produced through the GOD-catalyzed enzymatic reaction. Meanwhile, PB could not only catalyze H2O2 for oxygen generation to further promote glucose consumption but also possess the property of photothermal conversion. As a result, glucose was continuously consumed to achieve the starvation therapy (ST), and the photothermal therapy (PTT) could be realized under near-infrared (NIR) light. Besides, the Mn(2+) generated by the reaction of MnO2 with glutathione (GSH) could exert Fenton-like reaction to produce highly toxic hydroxyl radicals (.OH) from H2O2, which thereby realized self-reinforcing chemodynamic therapy (CDT). In vitro and in vivo experiments demonstrated that PBMO-GH could effectively inhibit the growth of tumor cells via ST/CDT/PTT synergistic effect.

In this study, the authors aimed to compare the precision of AR-assisted navigation and standard pointer-based neuronavigation (NV) by using a 3D-printed skull in surgical conditions. METHODS: A commercial standardized 3D-printed skull was scanned, fused, and referenced with an MR image and a CT scan of a patient with a 2 x 2-mm right frontal sinus defect. The defect was identified, registered, and integrated into NV. The target was physically marked on the 3D-printed skull replicating the right frontal sinus defect. Twenty-six subjects participated, 25 of whom had no prior NV or AR experience and 1 with little AR experience. The subjects were briefly trained in how to use NV, AR, and AR recalibration tools. Participants were asked to do the following: 1) \"target the center of the defect in the 3D-printed skull with a navigation pointer, assisted only by NV orientation,\" and 2) \"use the surgical microscope and AR to focus on the center of the projected object\" under conventional surgical conditions. For the AR task, the number of recalibrations was recorded. Confidence regarding NV and AR precision were assessed prior to and after the experiment by using a 9-level Likert scale.

In the AR task, the median number of recalibrations was 4 (Q1: 4, Q3: 4.75). The number of recalibrations was significantly correlated with the precision (Spearman rho: -0.71, p < 0.05). The trust assessment after performing the experiment scored a median of 8 for AR and 5.5 for NV (p < 0.01). CONCLUSIONS: This study shows for the first time the superiority of AR over NV in terms of precision. AR is easy to use. The number of recalibrations performed using reference structures increases the precision of the navigation. The confidence regarding precision increases with experience.',\n",

The physicochemical, structural and technological properties of mucilages extracted from seven cladodes of cacti native from the semi-arid region of the Brazil were investigated. The mucilages exhibited high yields (8.9 to 21.54%), high contents of carbohydrates (39.77 to 87.68%), proteins (4.27 to 14.76%), and minerals, specifically Ca (2.90 to 15.65%). All species evaluated presented a diverse monosaccharide composition, mainly constituted of galactose and arabinose, suggesting the presence of arabinogalactans as the main polysaccharides. Both showed peaks and bands characteristic of polysaccharides with semi-crystalline structure (14.50-38.60%), due to the high concentration of calcium. From the results, mucilages functional properties showed good water and oil retention capacities and a high emulsification capacity (100%) with stability above 83%. Foaming capacity was above 58% with stability greater than 95%. This study highlights the potential of using cacti as a source of functional mucilages for use in food applications.',\n",

The hCA I isoform was inhibited by these novel 4-(diethylamino)-salicylaldehyde-based thiosemicarbazones (3a-p) in low nanomolar levels, the Ki of which differed between 407.73 +/- 43.71 and 1104.11 +/- 80.66 nM. Against the physiologically dominant isoform hCA II, the novel compounds demonstrated Kis varying from 323.04 +/- 56.88 to 991.62 +/- 77.26 nM. Also, these novel 4-(diethylamino)-salicylaldehyde based thiosemicarbazones (3a-p) effectively inhibited AChE, with Ki values in the range of 121.74 +/- 23.52 to 548.63 +/- 73.74 nM. For BChE, Ki values were obtained with in the range of 132.85 +/- 12.53 to 618.53 +/- 74.23 nM. For alpha-glycosidase, the most effective Ki values of 3b, 3k, and 3g were with Ki values of 77.85 +/- 10.64, 96.15 +/- 9.64, and 124.95 +/- 11.44 nM, respectively. We have identified inhibition mechanism of 3b, 3g, 3k, and 3n on alpha-glycosidase AChE, hCA I, hCA II, and BChE enzyme activities. Hydrazine-1-carbothioamide and hydroxybenzylidene moieties of compounds play an important role in the inhibition of AChE, hCA I, and hCA II enzymes. Hydroxybenzylidene moieties are critical for inhibition of both BChE and alpha-glycosidase enzymes.

Herein, new hyaluronidase-responsive conjugated oligo(thiophene ethynylene) (OTE)-covalently modified hyaluronic acid (OTE-HA) nanoparticles for on-demand release of antimicrobial agents are reported. The synthesis of amphiphilic OTE-HA was carried out by esterification reaction. The resulting macromolecules were self-assembled in water to form nanoparticles, in which the hydrophobic OTE section, as bactericides, formed \"cores\" and the hydrophilic hyaluronic acid (HA) formed \"shells\". The OTE-HA nanoparticles avoid bactericide premature leakage and effectively block the dark cytotoxicity of the OTE section, possessing excellent biocompatibility. Using methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) as an example, hyaluronidase, largely secreted by MRSA, can in situ trigger the release of OTE via hydrolyzing OTE-HA nanoparticles into fragments, even disaccharides linked with OTE. Importantly, the OTE section could effectively break cell membranes, leading to bacterial death. The half-maximal inhibitory concentration of the nanoparticles against MRSA is 3.3 mug/mL. The great antibacterial activity of OTE-HA nanoparticles against Gram-positive bacteria Streptococcus pneumoniae further confirms the controllable bactericide delivery mechanism. OTE-HA nanoparticles coated on a surface can also effectively inhibit the growth of bacteria, which holds a remarkable promise in biomedical applications. Therefore, this work provides a favorable strategy of on-demand and in situ drug release for sterilization and defeating antimicrobial resistance.',\n",

Herein, we innovatively introduced the enzyme-assisted assembly to construct a bladder tumor-specific transformable peptide prodrug (i.e. HCPT-FF-GFLG-EEYSA). The prodrug targeted bladder tumor through the specific binding capacity of YSA to EphA2 and underwent on-demand structural transformation intracellularly from micelles to fibrils catalyzed by cathepsin B (CtsB), of which EphA2 and CtsB are overexpressed on the outer membrane and in cytoplasm of bladder tumor cells, respectively. Comparing with hydroxycamptothecin (HCPT), the prodrug can prolong the drug retention time and release the active drug in a sustained manner, which in turn decrease the administration frequencies of chemotherapeutics and reduce the side toxicities, etc. This strategy provides an alternative for bladder tumor chemotherapeutics and shows great potential to inhibit the relapse of postoperative tumors.',\n",

A combination of the molecules Y27632, A-83-01, and CHIR99021 has been used to reprogram rodent young hepatocytes into chemically induced liver progenitor (CLiP) cells; however, whether it could also reprogram aged hepatocytes has not yet been elucidated. METHODS: Primary hepatocytes were isolated from aged and young donor rats, respectively. Hepatic histological changes were evaluated. Differences in gene expression in hepatocytes were identified. The in vitro reprogramming plasticity of hepatocytes as evidenced by CLiP conversion and the hepatocyte and cholangiocyte maturation capacity of reprogrammed CLIPs were analyzed. The effect of hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) on cell propagation was also investigated. RESULTS: The histological findings revealed ongoing liver damage with inflammation, fibrosis, senescence, and ductular reaction in aged livers. Microarray analysis showed altered gene expression profiles in hepatocytes from aged donors, especially with regard to metabolic pathways. Aged hepatocytes could be converted into CLiPs (Aged-CLiPs) expressing progenitor cell markers, but with a relatively low proliferative rate compared with young hepatocytes. Aged-CLiPs possessed both hepatocyte and cholangiocyte maturation capacity. HGF facilitated CLiP conversion in aged hepatocytes, which was partly related to the activation of Erk1 and Akt1 signaling. CONCLUSIONS: Aged rat hepatocytes have retained reprogramming plasticity as evidenced by CLiP conversion in culture. HGF promoted proliferation and CLiP conversion in aged hepatocytes. Hepatocytes from aged donors may be used as an alternative cell source to mitigate donor shortage. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved.',\n",

Here, we fabricate hierarchical surfaces comprising tapered nanowire bunches and crisscross microgrooves. Nanosteps are formed around the top of the nanowire bunches, where the nanowires all around agglomerate densely because of surface tension. The theoretical analysis and molecular dynamics simulation show that nanostep morphologies that are around the top of the nanowire bunches can enable a lower energy barrier and a higher nucleation capability than those of the sparsely packed nanowires at the center and bottom of the nanowire bunches. Vapor condensation experiments demonstrate that the nucleation preferentially occurs around the top of the nanowire bunches.

Among various bimetallic compositions, Pd3Cu/C alloy NPs exhibits the best FAO and ORR activity. During FAO reaction, Pd3Cu/C alloy NPs exhibits a peak with a current density of 28.33 mA cm(-2) and a potential of 0.2 V (vs. Ag/AgCl) which is higher than that of the other PdCu compositions and standard 20 wt% Pd/C catalyst.

Experimental and DFT studies have confirmed that the enhanced activity can be attributed to the electronic effect that arises after Cu alloying which causes a downshift of Pd d-band center and structural effect that produces highly dispersed NPs over the carbon matrix with high electrochemically active surface area.',\n",

Monoclonal anti-horseradish peroxidase (anti-HRP) and monoclonal anti-fPSA antibodies (1 mg/mL) were reduced with 2-mercaptoethylamine (53 mM). Western blot confirmed the presence of rIgG as a band at 75 kDa, detectable only by anti-heavy chain but not by anti-light chain antibodies, suggesting a possible folding rearrangement. Using anti-HRP we confirmed the retention of the antigen binding capacity of rIgG.

Waste streams can originate from domestic and industrial sources and range from plastic waste to medical waste to various industrial waste streams, both solid and liquid. In addition to waste circularity, circularity for bio-based waste streams and renewable sources are also being investigated. To simplify this complexity, this article presents a case study evaluating the output from the feedstock recycling of plastic waste originating from municipal solid waste. Plastic waste entering the environment is undesired, and many initiatives are working towards a plastics circular economy. Once disposed of, ideally, plastic waste should be either re-used or recycled in order to avoid incineration or disposal in landfills. Recycling waste plastic can occur either via mechanical recycling or feedstock (chemical) recycling, where feedstock recycling can occur for example, through gasification or pyrolysis technologies. This article will focus only on the oils obtained from the pyrolysis of mixed waste plastic. The output from pyrolysis has a different composition than traditional fossil-based hydrocarbon streams, and therefore, must be evaluated to correctly process as feedstock. The authors have previously shown that gas chromatography coupled to vacuum ultraviolet detection (GC-VUV) provides accurate identification and quantification of the hydrocarbon composition (paraffins, isoparaffins, olefins, naphthenes, and aromatics - PIONA) of fossil-based liquid hydrocarbon streams.(1) Therefore, GC-VUV was evaluated for analysis of the pyrolysis oils from plastic waste. Using an in-house modified spectral library in combination with the PIONA+ software, accurate identification and quantification of the hydrocarbon composition of pyrolysis oils from C4 through C30+ was possible with a limit of detection of 0.1 wt.%.

The mir15a/mir16-1 expression was enriched in cardiomyocytes (CMs), decreased in hypertrophic human hearts, and decreased in mouse hearts after transverse aortic constriction (TAC). CM-specific mir15a/mir16-1 knockout promoted cardiac hypertrophy and dysfunction after TAC. CCAAT/enhancer binding protein (C/EBP)beta was responsible for the downregulation of mir15a/mir16-1 cluster transcription.

Intraoperative ultrasound (iUS) has emerged as a highly effective tool in this context. Navigated ultrasound (NUS) combines the benefits of real-time imaging with the benefits of navigation guidance. In this study, the authors investigated the use of NUS as an intraoperative adjunct for resection control in gliomas. METHODS: The authors retrospectively analyzed 210 glioma patients who underwent surgery using NUS at their center. The analysis included intraoperative decision-making, diagnostic accuracy, and operative outcomes, particularly EOR and related factors influencing this. RESULTS: US-defined gross-total resection (GTR) was achieved in 57.6% of patients. Intermediate resection control scans were evaluable in 115 instances. These prompted a change in the operative decision in 42.5% of cases (the majority being further resection of unanticipated residual tumor). Eventual MRI-defined GTR rates were similar (58.6%), although the concordance between US and MRI was 81% (170/210 cases). There were 21 false positives and 19 false negatives with NUS, resulting in a sensitivity of 78%, specificity of 83%, positive predictive value of 77%, and negative predictive value of 84%. A large proportion of patients (13/19 patients, 68%) with false-negative results eventually had near-total resections. Tumor resectability, delineation, enhancement pattern, eloquent location, and US image resolution significantly influenced the GTR rate, though only resectability and eloquent location were significant on multivariate analysis. CONCLUSIONS: NUS is a useful intraoperative adjunct for resection control in gliomas, detecting unanticipated tumor residues and positively influencing the course of the resection, eventually leading to higher resection rates. Nevertheless, resection is determined by the innate resectability of the tumor and its relationship to eloquent location, reinforcing the need to combine iUS with functional mapping techniques to optimize resections.',\n",

Interestingly these cocrystals exhibited very diverse dielectric response in the presence of an alternating current (ac) external electric field, and their dielectric behavior can be explained from the nature and strength of CT interactions in the cocrystal assembly.

Chemical shift anisotropy parameters, spin-lattice relaxation, and molecular correlation times obtained from (13)C solid-state NMR spectroscopy measurements establish the occurrence of molecular dynamics at the atomistic scale in cocrystals, thereby displaying high permittivity. Furthermore, we also propose a strategy directed toward the design of CT cocrystals that allows us to introduce rotational dynamics in noncentrosymmetric molecules, which significantly enhances their dielectric properties due to orientation polarization.

Developing novel therapeutic drugs about inhibiting excessive osteoclastogenesis acts as an efficient approach to preventing inflammatory bone destruction. METHODS: To study this, we explored the potential effects and mechanisms of compound 17 on inflammatory osteolysis in vitro. Meanwhile, a lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced calvarial osteolysis mouse model was used to evaluate the protective effect of compound 17 on inflammatory bone destruction in vivo. RESULTS: In our study, we found that compound 17 could inhibit osteoclast (OC) differentiation and bone resorption during RANKL and LPS stimulation in a time- and dose-dependent manner, while compounds 5 and 13 did not have the same effects. Mechanistically, compound 17 promoted phosphatase and tensin homologue (PTEN) activity by reducing PTEN ubiquitination, thereby restraining the RANKL-induced NF-kappaB pathway, resulting in the inhibition of the expression of osteoclastogenesis-related genes and the formation of the NLRP3 inflammasome. Additionally, we also investigated whether compound 17 could negatively modulate macrophage polarization and repolarization due to its anti-inflammatory effects. Moreover, compound 17 also plays an important role in osteoblast differentiation and mineralization. In vivo experiments showed that compound 17 could effectively protect mice from LPS-induced inflammatory bone destruction by inhibiting osteoclastogenesis and inflammation. CONCLUSIONS: Taken together, these results show that compound 17 might play protective role in inflammatory bone destruction through inhibiting osteoclastogenesis and inflammation.

Virtual screening of 75 FDA-approved potential antiviral drugs against the target proteins, spike (S) glycoprotein, human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (hACE2), 3-chymotrypsin-like cysteine protease (3CLpro), cathepsin L (CTSL), nucleocapsid protein, RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) and non-structural protein 6 (NSP6), resulted in the selection of seven drugs which preferentially bind to the target proteins. Further, the molecular interactions determined by molecular dynamics simulation revealed that among the 75 drug molecules, catechin can effectively bind to 3CLpro, CTSL, RBD of S protein, NSP6 and nucleocapsid protein. It is more conveniently involved in key molecular interactions, showing binding free energy (DeltaGbind) in the range of -5.09 kcal/mol (CTSL) to -26.09 kcal/mol (NSP6). At the binding pocket, catechin is majorly stabilized by the hydrophobic interactions, displays DeltaEvdW values: -7.59 to -37.39 kcal/mol. Thus, the structural insights of better binding affinity and favorable molecular interaction of catechin toward multiple target proteins signify that catechin can be potentially explored as a multi-targeted agent against COVID-19.',\n",

       "       [\"OBJECTIVE: Placement of a ventricular drain is one of the most common neurosurgical procedures. However, a higher rate of successful placements with this freehand procedure is desirable. The authors' objective was to develop a compact navigational augmented reality (AR)-based tool that does not require rigid patient head fixation, to support the surgeon during the operation. METHODS: Segmentation and tracking algorithms were developed. A commercially available Microsoft HoloLens AR headset in conjunction with Vuforia marker-based tracking was used to provide guidance for ventriculostomy in a custom-made 3D-printed head model. Eleven surgeons conducted a series of tests to place a total of 110 external ventricular drains under holographic guidance. The HoloLens was the sole active component; no rigid head fixation was necessary. CT was used to obtain puncture results and quantify success rates as well as precision of the suggested setup. RESULTS: In the proposed setup, the system worked reliably and performed well. The reported application showed an overall ventriculostomy success rate of 68.2%. The offset from the reference trajectory as displayed in the hologram was 5.2 +/- 2.6 mm (mean +/- standard deviation). A subgroup conducted a second series of punctures in which results and precision improved significantly. For most participants it was their first encounter with AR headset technology and the overall feedback was positive. CONCLUSIONS: To the authors' knowledge, this is the first report on marker-based, AR-guided ventriculostomy. The results from this first application are encouraging. The authors would expect good acceptance of this compact navigation device in a supposed clinical implementation and assume a steep learning curve in the application of this technique. To achieve this translation, further development of the marker system and implementation of the new hardware generation are planned. Further testing to address visuospatial issues is needed prior to application in humans.\",\n",

In this context, two factors are crucial in determining operating strategy: meningioma-brain interface and meningioma consistency. The use of intraoperative ultrasound (ioUS) elastosonography, a real-time imaging technique, has been introduced in general surgery to evaluate similar features in other pathological settings such as thyroid and prostate cancer. The aim of the present study was to evaluate ioUS elastosonography in the intraoperative prediction of key intracranial meningioma features and to evaluate its application in guiding surgical strategy. METHODS: An institutional series of 36 meningiomas studied with ioUS elastosonography is reported. Elastographic data, intraoperative surgical findings, and corresponding preoperative MRI features were classified, applying a score from 0 to 2 to both meningioma consistency and meningioma-brain interface. Statistical analysis was performed to determine the degree of agreement between meningioma elastosonographic features and surgical findings, and whether intraoperative elastosonography was a better predictor than preoperative MRI in assessing meningioma consistency and slip-brain interface, using intraoperative findings as the gold standard. RESULTS: A significantly high degree of reliability and agreement between ioUS elastographic scores and surgical finding scores was reported (intraclass correlation coefficient = 0.848, F = 12.147, p < 0.001). When analyzing both consistency and brain-tumor interface, ioUS elastography proved to have a rather elevated sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV), negative predictive value (NPV), and positive (LR+) and negative likelihood ratio (LR-). This consideration was true especially for meningiomas with a hard consistency (sensitivity = 0.92, specificity = 0.96, PPV = 0.92, NPV = 0.96, LR+ = 22.00, LR- = 0.09) and for those presenting with an adherent slip-brain interface (sensitivity = 0.76, specificity = 0.95, PPV = 0.93, NPV = 0.82, LR+ = 14.3, LR- = 0.25). Furthermore, predictions derived from ioUS elastography were found to be more accurate than MRI-derived predictions, as demonstrated by McNemar's test results in both consistency (p < 0.001) and interface (p < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: While external validation of the data is needed to transform ioUS elastography into a fully deployable clinical tool, this experience confirmed that it may be integrated into meningioma surgical planning, especially because of its rapidity and cost-effectiveness.\",\n",

       "       [\"In the field of fluorescence microscopy, there is continued demand for dynamic technologies that can exploit the complete information from every pixel of an image. One imaging technique with proven ability for yielding additional information from fluorescence imaging is Fluorescence Lifetime Imaging Microscopy (FLIM). FLIM allows for the measurement of how long a fluorophore stays in an excited energy state, and this measurement is affected by changes in its chemical microenvironment, such as proximity to other fluorophores, pH, and hydrophobic regions. This ability to provide information about the microenvironment has made FLIM a powerful tool for cellular imaging studies ranging from metabolic measurement to measuring distances between proteins. The increased use of FLIM has necessitated the development of computational tools for integrating FLIM analysis with image and data processing. To address this need, we have created FLIMJ, an ImageJ plugin and toolkit that allows for easy use and development of extensible image analysis workflows with FLIM data. Built on the FLIMLib decay curve fitting library and the ImageJ Ops framework, FLIMJ offers FLIM fitting routines with seamless integration with many other ImageJ components, and the ability to be extended to create complex FLIM analysis workflows. Building on ImageJ Ops also enables FLIMJ's routines to be used with Jupyter notebooks and integrate naturally with science-friendly programming in, e.g., Python and Groovy. We show the extensibility of FLIMJ in two analysis scenarios: lifetime-based image segmentation and image colocalization. We also validate the fitting routines by comparing them against industry FLIM analysis standards.\",\n",

The Shh pathway requires functional primary cilia, microtubule-based organelles present on virtually every cell and acting as cellular antennae to receive and transduce diverse chemical, mechanical or light signals. The dysfunction of cilia in humans leads to inherited diseases called ciliopathies, which often affect many organs and show diverse manifestations including forebrain malformations for the most severe forms. The purpose of this review is to provide the reader with a framework to understand the developmental origin of the forebrain defects observed in severe ciliopathies with respect to perturbations of the Shh pathway. We propose that many of these defects can be interpreted as an imbalance in the ratio of activator to repressor forms of the Gli transcription factors, which are effectors of the Shh pathway. We also discuss the complexity of ciliopathies and their relationships with forebrain disorders such as holoprosencephaly or malformations of cortical development, and emphasize the need for a closer examination of forebrain defects in ciliopathies, not only through the lens of animal models but also taking advantage of the increasing potential of the research on human tissues and organoids.',\n",

       "       [\"Deep learning technology has been widely used in fault diagnosis for chemical processes. However, most deep learning technologies currently adopted only use a single network stack or a certain network stack with multilayer perceptron (MLP) behind it. Compared with traditional fault diagnosis technologies, this method has made progress in both the diagnosis accuracy and speed, but due to the limited performance of a single network, the accuracy or speed cannot meet the requirements to the greatest extent. In order to overcome such problems, this article proposes a fault diagnosis method using deep learning multimodel fusion. Different from previous deep learning diagnosis methods, this method uses long short-term memory (LSTM) and convolutional neural network (CNN) to extract features separately. The extracted features are then fused and MLP is taken as the input for further feature compression and extraction, and finally the diagnosis results will be obtained. LSTM has long-term memory capabilities, the extracted features have temporal characteristics, and CNNs have a good effect on the extraction of spatial features. The proposed method integrates these two aspects for diagnosis such that the features finally extracted by the network have both spatial and temporal characteristics, thereby improving the network's diagnostic performance. Finally, a TE chemical process and an industrial coking furnace process are taken for simulation testing. It is proved that the performance of this method is superior to existing deep learning fault diagnosis methods with simple sequential stacking for unilateral feature extraction.\",\n",

A layer of superhydrophobic polydivinylbenzene (PDVB) nanoparticles is spin-coated on the back surface of different types of papers. The spreading of a water droplet on the top, uncoated surface is dependent on the size of the PDVB nanoparticles in the coating. Using a relationship derived from Darcy's law, we observe that the energy barrier for the spreading of water droplets on three types of papers (heavy-weight, light-weight, and slight-weight papers) decreases with the decrease of the nanoparticle size in the back-surface coating. The spreading of the water droplet is dependent on the porous structure, permeability, and compressibility of the papers.

Especially, the traditional method of extracting gamma-PGA is organic solvent extraction, etc., which has the disadvantages of low extraction rate and serious environmental pollution. With the expansion of gamma-PGA industrial fermentation, an efficient and environmentally friendly method is required to be adopted. In this contribution, we report a novel method of separation of gamma-PGA from fermentation broth based on molecular imprinting technology. The molecular imprinted polymer (MIP) was synthesized from chitosan (CS) and glutaraldehyde in the presence of gamma-PGA. A nonimprinted polymer (NIP) was also synthesized by the same procedure in the absence of gamma-PGA. The chemical structures and morphological structures of both MIP and NIP were examined by FTIR spectroscopy and scanning electron microscopy. The adsorption isotherms showed that the maximum adsorption capacity of MIP was 137.85mg/g. The maximum adsorption capacity in the adsorption of NIP was 68.92mg/g, which indicates that MIP shows specific selectivity for gamma-PGA. A high saturated absorption capacity (Qmax=140.90mg/g) was calculated from Freundlich isotherm equation. The imprinting factor of MIP was 4.76, indicating that MIP possess good recognition ability and selectivity for gamma-PGA. The adsorption capacity decreased slightly (17.0%), which suggests the satisfactory reusability of gamma-PGA after 5cycles of reuse.

SNFs often have a high topographical heterogeneity and abiotic conditions, which differ from their surroundings; therefore, they provide a unique opportunity for establishing links between environmental heterogeneity (EH) and biodiversity. However, no study has so far investigated the EH components of topographically heterogeneous SNFs in a comprehensive framework, by linking environmental and biotic parameters. To fill this knowledge gap, we evaluated the EH components and their effect on biodiversity on ancient mounds covered by semi-natural grasslands in the Pannonian (Hungary) and Continental (Bulgaria) biogeographical regions. We designated 16 study sites, each containing a few-metre-high mounds with five microsites (top, north-, east-, south- and west-facing slopes) and a nearby plain grassland. At each microsite, we measured soil moisture, soil chemical properties, solar radiation and microclimate; and recorded the cover of vascular plants in a total of 480 plots. On the mounds, topographical heterogeneity was associated with sharp differences in microclimate and soil properties. Besides the contrast between mild north-facing and harsh south-facing slopes, east- and west-facing slopes also sustained unique microsites characterised by dynamic diurnal changes in air temperature and vapour pressure deficit. Various combinations of the EH components resulted in unique plant species compositions within the microsites, and supported the co-occurrence of species typical of contrasting habitat types, even within a couple of metres. By combining high-resolution measurements of abiotic factors with fine-scale vegetation sampling, our study provides evidence that widespread SNFs with complex topography harbour several grassland-specialist plant species and introduce a high level of EH to otherwise homogeneous plain landscapes, which cover one third of the global land area.',\n",

From the center of each of the lakes, we selected one master core for age determination by (210)Pb and (137)Cs radioisotopes. The contents of OC, TN, TP, dry bulk density and mass specific magnetic susceptibility were then determined for all cores.

Significantly enhanced nutrient burial by these lakes after the 1950s resulted from increased anthropogenic impacts in northeast China.

Despite significant investment, there are still fundamental issues that are incompletely understood. Three of the recently approved ADCs contain payloads exhibiting bystander effects, where the payload can diffuse out of a targeted cell into adjacent cells. These effects are often studied using a mosaic of antigen positive and negative cells. However, the distance these payloads can diffuse in tumor tissue while maintaining a lethal concentration is unclear. Computational studies suggest bystander effects partially compensate for ADC heterogeneity in tumors in addition to targeting antigen negative cells. However, this type of study is challenging to conduct experimentally due to the low concentrations of extremely potent payloads. In this work, we use a series of 3-dimensional cell culture and primary human tumor xenograft studies to directly track fluorescently labeled ADCs and indirectly follow the payload via an established pharmacodynamic marker (gammaH2A.

The penetration distance is similar to model predictions, where the lipophilicity results in moderate tissue penetration, thereby balancing improved tissue penetration with sufficient cellular uptake to avoid significant washout.

The results indicate that both Cd-O/N and Cd-S bonds exist in the complex of Cd(II) with dithiocarbamate chitosan (DTC-CTS). S functional groups (dithiocarbamate) in DTC-CTS play the major role in complexation with Cd(II) and S content affects the adsorption mechanism. At low S content, Cd(II) is mainly adsorbed on DTC-CTS as an outer-sphere complex with two monodentate amino groups and two water molecules in tetrahedral configuration. At high S content, Cd adsorption dominantly occurs by formation of an inner-sphere complex with two bidentate mononuclear S ligands in tetrahedral configuration. This investigation provides information on the effectiveness and mechanisms of Cd(II) removal that is critical for evaluating modified chitosan applications for stabilization of Cd(II) in surface water, groundwater, soils and sediments.',\n",

Our simulations led to a dimer structure that is indistinguishable from the experimentally determined gA channel structures, with the two gA subunits joined by six hydrogen bonds (6HB). The simulations also uncovered two additional dimer structures, with different gA-gA stacking orientations that were stabilized by four or two hydrogen bonds (4HB or 2HB). When examining the temporal evolution of the dimerization, we found that two bilayer-inserted gA subunits can form the 6HB dimer directly, with no discernible intermediate states, as well as through paths that involve the 2HB and 4HB dimers.',\n",

To maintain the performance, the device should be packaged in such a way that it hermetically blocks moisture from the device; however, in practice, it is rather difficult to achieve. The more practical solution is to impede the moisture ingress to the device. In optoelectronic devices that will be outdoors like solar cells, the interfacial adhesion strength between the encapsulant layer (adhesive) and a moisture barrier layer is also a critical parameter. This paper presents surface modifications of poly(ethylene terephthalate) (PET) carrier films, one of the layers in the trilayer barrier film that directly adheres to an encapsulant, using chemical, UV/ozone, and both treatments to improve adhesion with the thermoset encapsulant polymer material. Whereas previous studies also utilized treatment methods to increase the wettability characteristics, in this paper, we not only present the results of the adhesion strength upon various techniques to achieve good adhesion but also screen their behavior upon exposure to a damp-heat (60 degrees C, 90% RH) environment. We found that the combined treatment method increases the adhesion by up to 12.1-fold and demonstrates up to a 200% increase in adhesion strength even upon our severe damp-heat environmental condition.',\n",

However, the chemical and structural state of Cu catalyst surfaces during the CO2RR remains a matter of debate. Here, we show the structural evolution of the near-surface region of polycrystalline Cu electrodes under in situ conditions through a combination of grazing incidence X-ray absorption spectroscopy (GIXAS) and X-ray diffraction (GIXRD). The in situ GIXAS reveals that the surface oxide layer is fully reduced to metallic Cu before the onset potential for CO2RR, and the catalyst maintains the metallic state across the potentials relevant to the CO2RR. We also find a preferential surface reconstruction of the polycrystalline Cu surface toward (100) facets in the presence of CO2. Quantitative analysis of the reconstruction profiles reveals that the degree of reconstruction increases with increasingly negative applied potentials, and it persists when the applied potential returns to more positive values. These findings show that the surface of Cu electrocatalysts is dynamic during the CO2RR, and emphasize the importance of in situ characterization to understand the surface structure and its role in electrocatalysis.',\n",

CMFs were extracted and treated using physicochemical method followed by enzymatic treatment with laccase and cellulase. The effects of CMFs concentrations (1.5, 3 and 6% w/w) and fiber size (75 mum-1.7 mm) on the mechanical properties (impact and tensile) and biodegradability of the biocomposite samples were investigated. A modified interfacial adhesion between rPLA matrix and the three fibers used, was clearly observed through mechanical tests due to alkali and enzymatic treatments. The use of different types of enzymatically treated cellulosic fibers for polylactic acid (PLA) recycling was assessed by Scaning electron microscopy (SEM), X-ray diffraction (XRD) and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR). The combined physicochemical and enzymatic treatments led to a considerable size reduction of the cellulosic fibers (HF, MS and DS) resulting in the enhanced interfacial adhesion between rPLA matrix and fibers. The biocomposite obtained with rPLA with HF gave the most favorable values for Young's modulus (324.53 +/- 3.10 MPa, p-value 0.03), impact strength (27.61 +/- 2.94 kJ/m(2), p-value 0.01) and biodegradation rate (1.97%).\",\n",

In recent history, the importance of navigated approaches to spinal screw placement is constantly increasing. A growing number of medical centers have introduced intraoperative CT (iCT) navigation as a new clinical standard. In this study, we compare the accuracy of dorsal iCT-navigated instrumentation in revision surgery versus primary interventions. METHODS: Between September 2017 and January 2019, we prospectively analyzed a consecutive series of dorsal instrumentation using iCT. Patients with previous operative interventions in the relevant spinal segments were included in the revision group and compared with a previously assessed group of primary interventions (nonrevision group). Each screw was assessed individually by an independent observer, making use of a modified Gertzbein and Robbins classification. RESULTS: In this period, 39 patients were treated in the revision group with a total amount of 269 implanted screws. We achieved an overall accuracy of 95.91% compared with 95.12% in the nonrevision group (46 patients, 287 screws). We found no significant difference in accuracy between the two groups or any anatomical region of the spine. CONCLUSION: In summary, iCT-navigated screw placement yields a good accuracy in spinal revision surgery, without significant difference to primary interventions.\",\n",

The X-ray crystal structure of the AuAg26 nanocluster is composed of a AuAg12 icosahedron kernel and a Ag14(SR)18S open shell. The shell includes a Ag6(SR)3S, a Ag5(SR)6, and three Ag(SR)3 motifs.

Due to the novel open shell configuration of Ag14(SR)18S, four triangular facets of the kernel are exposed. The AuAg26 nanocluster shows excellent catalytic activity in the electrochemical reduction of CO2 to CO. The Faradaic efficiency of CO is up to 98.4% under -0.97 V.

Soil properties, microbial activities, and the geochemical fractions and potential availabilities of As and Pb were determined in the non-treated (control) and biochar-treated soil. Modification of PB (pH = 10.6) and GWB (pH = 9.3) with Fe caused a decrease in their pH to 4.4 and 3.4, respectively. The application of PB and GWB significantly increased soil pH, while Fe-PB and Fe-GWB decreased soil pH, as compared to the control. Application of Fe-GWB and Fe-PB decreased the NH4H2PO4-extractable As by 32.8 and 35.9%, which was more effective than addition of GWB and PB. However, PB and GWB were more effective than Fe-PB and Fe-GWB in Pb immobilization. Compared to the control, the DTPA-extractable Pb decreased by 20.6 and 21.7%, respectively, following PB and GWB application. Both biochars, particularly PB significantly increased the 16S rRNA bacterial gene copy numbers, indicating that biochar amendments enhanced the bacterial abundance, implying an alleviation of As and Pb bio-toxicity to soil bacteria.

Results show that the rate of spreading of the smaller vesicles ( approximately 70 nm) is about 1.4 times slower than those of larger ones ( approximately 1 mu) and that DOPC has the highest elastic compliance compared with DOPC + DOPG and DOPC + DODAB vesicles. A direct correlation between the elastic compliance and the size of the vesicles shows larger vesicles are more structurally labile during adsorption and subsequent adhesion to solid surfaces than the smaller ones. Specific role of bound water in DODAB is reflected in the lowest elastic compliance of DODAB compared to other lipids. Results show that during the process of adhesion at the fluid/air interface, the vesicles undergo contraction, thereby transmitting mechanical stresses to their microenvironment, which matches the SAXS electron density profiles that indicates larger vesicles have thicker bilayer membranes with larger volume of water compared to the smaller sized ones.\",\n",

These emissions are a significant source of many air pollutants formed during incomplete combustion and has been identified as one of the leading environmental risk factors for these populations. One of the solutions is to utilise thermally processed solid fuels. This article discusses the concentrations of pollutants emitted as a result of the combustion of conventional fuels and new low-emission fuel in out-of-class heaters. To gain better insight into the relationships between fuel type and flue gas quality, chemometric methods and variance analysis were used. Principal component analysis confirmed that the fuel type significantly influences the level of dust emissions and the total organic carbon and sum of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons in the dust. Clustering analysis identified how the concentrations of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons correlate with the amounts of dust and total organic carbon and showed that this correlation is proportional to the size of the molecule and consequently the number of aromatic rings. The use of low-emission fuel as a solid fuel in households, as our analyses have shown, can reduce the concentrations of dust, total organic carbon and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons by up to 50 times, thereby reducing air pollutants in cities.',\n",

Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was performed before and after catheter implantation to quantify the differences based on catheter placement location in the cervical compared to the lumbar spine. Several geometric and hydrodynamic parameters were calculated based on the 3D segmentation and flow analysis. Hagen-Poiseuille equation was used to investigate the impact of catheter implantation on flow reduction and hydraulic resistance. A linear mixed-effects model was used in this study to investigate if there was a statistically significant difference between cervical and lumbar implantation, or between two MRI time points. Results showed that geometric parameters did not change statistically across MRI measurement time points and did not depend on catheter location.

Experimental results show that at a given rotational speed and liquid flow rate, the pinned disc generates more intense cavitation (i.e. lower cavitation number, higher volume fraction of vapor and higher amplitude of pressure fluctuations) than the serrated disc, while also consuming less energy per liquid pass (i.e., higher flow rate and pumping pressure difference of water at similar power consumption). Additionally, mechanical and chemical wastewater treatment performance of the novel cavitator was evaluated on an 800 L influent sample from a wastewater treatment plant.

However, the differences in the mechanism of QS inhibition between DAS and DADS, and the functional chemical groups of these sulfides that contribute in QS inhibition have not been elucidated yet. We assumed that the sulfide group might play a key role in QS inhibition. To prove this hypothesis and to clarify these unsolved problems, in this study, we synthesized diallyl ether (DAE), and compared and investigated the effects of DAS and DAE on the growth and production of virulence factors, including Pseudomonas quinolone signal (PQS), elastase and pyocyanin, of P. aeruginosa PAO1. Transcriptome analysis and qRT-PCR were used to compare and analyse the differentially expressed genes between the different treatment groups (DAS, DAE and control). The results indicated that DAS did not affect the growth dynamics of P. aeruginosa PAO1; however, DAS inhibited transcription of most of the QS system genes, including lasR, rhlI/rhlR and pqsABCDE/pqsR; thus, biosynthesis of the signal molecules C4 -HSL (encoded by rhlI) and PQS (encoded by pqsABCDE) was inhibited. Furthermore, DAS inhibited the transcription of virulence genes regulated by the QS systems, including rhlABC, lasA, lasB, lecA and phzAB, phzDEFG, phzM and phzS that encode for rhamnolipid, exoprotease, elastase, lectin and pyocyanin biosynthesis respectively. DAS also enhanced the expression of the key genes involved in the biosynthesis of three B vitamins: folate, thiamine and riboflavin. In conclusion, DAS suppressed the production of some virulence factors toxic to the host and enhanced the production of some nutrition factors beneficial to the host. These actions of DAS may be due to its thioether group.
